The regional water availability is determined as a function of precipitation. Detailed water balance at the district level accounts for groundwater recharge and surface water availability. Water left over from the previous season can be used in the next season. The water withdrawal for crops providing agricultural residue to produce ethanol is limited by a seasonal water stress factor. The key decision variables are land allocation for selected crops and choice of residues for ethanol production, all while ensuring state-level ethanol production targets are met. The primary goals are to maximize farmers’ profit, minimize ethanol cost, and minimize water withdrawals while meeting the ethanol production targets. The resulting multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming problem is applied to a case study of 33 districts in Maharashtra, India. Results compare optimized land practices from the model with current practices, where current land use causes 78.5% water stress. Upon further reducing water consumption by 38.5% compared to the current land use practices and for an ethanol blending rate of 15%, profits reduced by 27.6%, from USD 388.06/ha to USD 288.88/ha. The ethanol water footprint decreased 1.7-fold from 937 to 528 liters per liter of ethanol, and irrigation water use dropped 14.8-fold from 3878 to 262 m3/ha. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Energy–water nexus; Optimization; Regional sustainability; Water stress"

However, its utilization faces significant supply chain challenges. The biomass supply chain (BSC) encompasses harvesting, collection, transportation, storage, preprocessing, production, and delivery of bio-products. High moisture content and low calorific value of biomass result in high cost of logistics, and consequently high cost of delivered biomass. Other challenges in BSC are related to uncertainties and variations in biomass availability and quality, weather conditions, demand, prices, costs, and policies. Integrating strategic, tactical, and operational decisions is essential to ensure that high-level plans are implementable at lower levels; however, accounting for uncertainties in such integrated decision-making models requires advanced techniques. This paper reviews existing studies on hybrid simulation optimization techniques—specifically the integration of simulation models (e.g., Discrete Event Simulation) with optimization approaches (e.g., mixed integer linear programming)) in BSC management, focusing on forest-based, agricultural BSC planning, and biomass to biofuel/bioenergy supply chain planning. The studies are further categorized into three subgroups based on their use of hybrid models: (1) manage uncertainties, (2) tackle large-scale problems, and (3) interpret complex interdependencies. We analyzed 31 articles published till July 2025 using a systematic approach that combines bibliometric and descriptive analyses. The most commonly applied simulation and optimization approaches were Monte Carlo, discrete event simulation, mixed integer linear programming, and stochastic modeling. Future research could focus on developing multi-objective hybrid models to address sustainability, using machine learning techniques to address uncertainties, and considering relevant governmental policies in the models. Emphasis on resiliency and use of agent-based simulation can enhance decision-making and sustainability. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.","Agricultural biomass; Decision-making; Forest-based biomass; Large-scale optimization problems; Uncertainty"

With its ability to be produced from a variety of biomass sources, including non-edible ones like macro-algae, animal fat and used cooking oil, biofuels have the potential to provide a sustainable energy alternative to non-renewable sources. Macro-algae serves as a cost-effective and accessible solution for energy generation. Accelerated biodiesel supply chain development is essential to support large-scale sustainable production. This research focuses on designing an optimized and sustainable supply chain for third-generation biodiesel production from macro-algae. The main contribution lies in developing a multi-objective optimization model that minimizes supply chain costs and environmental impacts while addressing critical factors such as transportation logistics, facility placement and the impact of advertising on biodiesel demand. The proposed strategy effectively reduces supply chain costs and environmental impacts. Advertising promotes biodiesel as an alternative to fossil fuels, thereby influencing its demand. The proposed multi-objective optimization model is implemented using the Genetic Algorithm. Three macro-algae species (Ulva fasciata, Cystoseira indica and Gracilaria corticata) are strategically integrated into an extensive network of bio-refineries, biodiesel depots, multi-extraction centres and diverse supply sources. The findings highlight substantial costs associated with biofuel supply chain installation, with production facilities accounting for 61.6% of the biodiesel setup costs. Biofuel supply chain installation contributes 69.8% of the total environmental impact. A numerical example and sensitivity analysis of essential factors are conducted to assess the model’s practicality and validity. © The Author(s) 2025.","Advertisement; Biodiesel; Genetic algorithm; Macro-algae; Sustainable energy"

The system aims to enhance the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability of marine power systems. Biodiesel is converted into hydrogen-rich syngas via autothermal reforming, while the residual heat drives methanol steam reforming. This configuration enables cascading waste heat utilization and fuel complementarity. The performances of single-fuel and dual-fuel systems are compared using an energy-economy-environment (3E) analysis. Results indicate that the dual-fuel system achieves a power generation efficiency of 40.85 %, representing a 9.99 % increase over the single-fuel system. Combined heat and power (CHP) efficiency rises by 2.81 %–82.95 %, and power generation increases by 101.33 % (reaching 855.10 kW). Life cycle assessment reveals that the green methanol pathway reduces carbon emissions by 55.41 % (to 294.58 g/kWh) compared to conventional diesel. Optimal operating parameters, determined via NSGA-II multi-objective optimization, further improve power generation efficiency to 47.06 %–15.20 % higher than the design operating point.

A multi-objective optimization balancing net present value (NPV) and avoided CO<inf>2</inf> emissions reveals that energy integration improves environmental performance with limited economic impact. The model estimates the production of up to 66.85 kg of biomethanol/ton sugarcane from bagasse gasification, 40.7 kg e-methanol/ton sugarcane via CO<inf>2</inf> hydrogenation, and 3.68 kg of biomethane/ton sugarcane from biogas upgrading. Hydrogen production through biomethane reforming and photovoltaic-powered electrolysis increases methanol output without raising emissions. The integrated system achieves energy efficiencies of up to 57.3% and enables the avoidance of up to 493 kg of CO<inf>2</inf>/ton sugarcane over the planning horizon.

Biohydrogen, produced from renewable biomass, is a stable and dispatchable source of low-carbon hydrogen, helping to address supply fluctuations caused by the intermittency of renewable electricity and the limited availability of electrolytic hydrogen. This study experimentally demonstrates that sorption-enhanced steam reforming (SESR) is a robust and adaptable process for hydrogen production from biomass-derived syngas-like gas streams. By incorporating in situ CO<inf>2</inf> capture, SESR overcomes the thermodynamic limits of conventional reforming, achieving high hydrogen yields (>96 %) and purities (up to 99.8 vol%) across a wide range of syngas compositions. The process maintains high conversion efficiency despite variations in CO, CH<inf>4</inf>, and CO<inf>2</inf> concentrations, and sustains performance even with H<inf>2</inf>-rich feeds, conditions that typically inhibit reforming reactions. Among the operating parameters, temperature has the greatest influence on performance, followed by the steam-to-carbon ratio and space velocity. Multi-objective optimization shows that SESR can maintain high hydrogen yield (>96 %), selectivity (>99 %), and purity (>99.5 vol%) within a moderately flexible operating window. Methane reforming is identified as the main performance-limiting step, with a stronger constraint on H<inf>2</inf> yield and purity than CO conversion through the water–gas shift reaction. In addition to hydrogen, SESR produces a concentrated CO<inf>2</inf> stream suitable for downstream utilization or storage. These results support the potential of SESR as a flexible and efficient approach for hydrogen production from heterogeneous renewable feedstocks. © 2025 The Authors","Biomass; CO2 capture; Dolomite; Hydrogen production; Sorption-enhanced steam reforming; Syngas"

Traditional approaches treat these objectives as competing trade-offs, forcing engineers to compromise either economics or safety. This study demonstrates that properly integrated safety constraints actually reduce total costs. A mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) framework was developed through General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) that simultaneously optimizes economic aspects, safety aspects, and multi-floor design. The methodology was applied to five industrial plant types: petrochemical, food and pharmaceutical, polymer, biofuel, and chemical fertilizer facilities, handling equipment weight variations ranging from 41.874 kg to 9,865.21 kg. Process data were obtained from Aspen Plus simulations, Dow's Fire & Explosion Index, and engineering heuristics for piping/pumping cost estimation. To overcome GAMS's computational limits (maximum 2,500 variables and 2,500 constraints), the problem was decomposed into three sequential models: Model 1 for material selection, Model 2 for multi-floor layout optimization, and Model 3 for section arrangement. Each model incorporates over 75 constraints ensuring structural integrity, safety compliance, and operational feasibility. The designs were validated through AutoCAD Plant 3D visualization. Results demonstrate significant improvements: the biodiesel plant achieved 14.4 % cost reduction when safety constraints were integrated, all facilities successfully implemented adaptive multi-floor configurations (1–3 floors), and the framework scaled effectively across diverse applications. This work provides comprehensive evidence that integrated safety-economic optimization delivers superior outcomes, transforming safety from a cost burden into an economic opportunity.

A multi-objective optimization framework employing Pareto fronts was used to evaluate the economic and environmental impact of integrating each pathway into a biorefinery producing renewable fuel from corn stover-derived BDO. Minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) and lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the renewable fuel were chosen as the objective functions. Using a single distillation column to recover BDO resulted in GHG emissions of 43 g<inf>CO2e</inf> (CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent)/MJ, ∼50 % lower than petroleum-based fuel (93 g<inf>CO2e</inf>/MJ), but an MFSP of $2.55/GGE (gallon of gasoline equivalent, 1GGE = 121.3 MJ), exceeding the $2.50/GGE threshold set by the U.S. Department of Energy. In comparison, the SMB system lowered energy demand in the distillation columns and reduced GHG emissions to 18 g<inf>CO2e</inf>/MJ and MFSP to $2.40/GGE. Further exploration of this pathway led to the use of heat pumps to replace fossil-based steam utilities in the distillation columns. The final separation process design recommendation was an SMB system followed by two distillation columns, with only one column electrified by a mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) heat pump loop. This configuration attained GHG emissions of 13 g<inf>CO2e</inf>/MJ and an MFSP of $2.50/GGE.

However, the primary challenge for stable biorefinery operations lies in the cultivation phase, as microalgae growth is highly dependent on time-varying climatic conditions. This work presents an optimal biorefinery process pathway to address this issue by integrating economic and environmental considerations with harvest scheduling under fluctuating climate conditions. In the first stage, a kinetic growth model was developed for eight microalgae species, incorporating temperature and solar radiation data. Harvest scheduling was then optimized using a genetic algorithm to find the optimal harvest interval for each microalgae species, maximizing the biomass yield under time-varying climate conditions. Subsequently, a multi-objective superstructure optimization approach was employed to select the optimal biorefinery process pathway, balancing the net operational margin and carbon dioxide emissions. The performance of the selected biorefinery process was evaluated through techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment across four regions in South Korea: Jeju, Yeosu, Ulsan, and Daesan. Among the eight microalgae species studied, Asterionella formosa achieved the highest biomass yield, producing 2,300 tons annually with an optimal harvest interval of 17.5 days under average temperature conditions. The optimized process improved the net operational margin by 2.49 M$ per year and reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 41.4 % compared to the base case.

An artificial neural network integrated with multi-objective particle swarm optimization (ANN-PSO) was employed to identify optimal operating parameters. The optimized configurations improved BTE and reduced NOx emissions across all loads; for example, at 75% load, BTE increased from 30.38% (average) to 32.13% (optimum), while simultaneously reducing the NOx emissions from 1322 ppm (average) to 1272 ppm (optimum). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed load as the most significant factor (p < 0.001), followed by injection timing and NP size.

After characterising oil and choosing the independent variables of the reaction (methanol-to-oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration, temperature, and stirring), three dependent variables were selected to analyse biodiesel production globally, considering technical, energetic and environmental aspects. Therefore, biodiesel yield, energy intensity, and green chemistry balance were chosen as responses. This work considered four normalised green metrics with the best values close to 100 % to calculate the green chemistry balance and the “greenness” of the reaction, providing a comprehensive view of the sustainability of biodiesel production. After obtaining an experimental plan using a central composite design, the process responses under different operating conditions were assessed. The optimal conditions were obtained by response surface methodology and optimisation tools in both a single-criterion approach for each response and a multi-objective approach. Moreover, the analysis of variance was performed to determine the significance of quadratic models and the effects of independent factors on each response. When the three responses were simultaneously optimised, the results showed a maximum ester yield of 83.3 %, minimum energy intensity of 10.2 MJ/kg, and maximum green chemistry balance of 81.4 % at methanol to oil molar ratio of 3, KOH catalyst concentration of 1.3 wt%, temperature of 50.7 °C and stirring of 350 rpm.

This research critically addresses inconsistencies in life cycle assessment related to functional units, system boundaries, and impact allocation of products, fostering a consistent and robust environmental diagnostic. Experimental data from urban forest waste torrefaction, combined with a two-step kinetic modeling, enabled the simulation of a scaled-up system using Aspen Plus. This integrative approach assessed the properties of biocoal, bio-oil, and torgas, as well as mass and energy flows, irreversibilities, and process emissions.

Wide acceptance is hindered by excessive viscosity, poor cold flow, and weak oxidative stability. Incorporating nanomaterials, such as ZnO nanoparticles, has shown potential in enhancing biodiesel's properties. Previous studies have improved biofuel formulations or engine optimization, but a comprehensive strategy using advanced modeling and optimization techniques is lacking. In the present investigation, the fuel properties were enhanced by addition of ethanol as oxygenated additives and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles. The engine combustion characters are modelled using deep learning neural networks (DNN) and single-layered neural networks (ANN). Using wider network topology, experimentation with different number of neurons of hidden layer is performed to obtain the optimal coefficient of determination (R-squared). Engine characteristics like brake thermal efficiency (BTE), carbon monoxide (CO), smoke, Hydrocarbon (HC), and ignition delay (ID) are optimized using dragonfly algorithm (DA). Single objective optimization using DA and multi-objective optimization using DA (MODA) is carried out. The DA and MODA are executed for number of cycles and the optimal values and pareto fronts are analyzed. ANN modelling has shown lower in prediction of the engine combustion characters while DNN is a big success. Deep learning models accurately predicted key engine parameters like heat release rate (HRR) and in-cylinder pressure (ICP), achieving R2 > 0.95. The engine emissions are within an acceptable range, and the BTE is within the range of 20 %–32 % as a result of the engine performance optimization. The optimization of engine characteristics is achieved through the incorporation of nanoparticles in biodiesel.

The findings underscore critical trade-offs between land use, fuel production costs, and emissions reductions in achieving national SAF targets. In cost-optimized scenarios, sorghum and miscanthus comprise most of the production (together >95%), achieving minimum fuel selling prices as low as $3.24 gallon–1. Cultivation land-minimizing scenarios favor algae exclusively, reducing land use to 0.5% of the contiguous U.S., but with higher fuel prices and emissions.

This approach combines the performance assessment strengths of data envelopment analysis with the predictive capabilities of neural networks, enabling a data-informed site selection process.

A probabilistic scenario-based approach is utilized to address uncertainties, enhancing the model's real-world applicability. Additionally, the Lagrangian relaxation technique is implemented to achieve precise solutions while preserving computational efficiency. For large-scale scenarios, the study leverages the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm and multi-objective simulated annealing to generate near-optimal solutions.

The proposed model includes two separate channels for the collection, production, and distribution of corn grain products (canned and corn oil) as well as the production and distribution of biofuel from corn residues. To deal with the uncertainty in the most important parameters, scenario-based robust optimization has been utilized. Next, a hybrid augmented epsilon constraint and Lagrangian Relaxation is proposed to find the Pareto solution. Finally, a real case study in Iran is analyzed to validate the model's applicability and effectiveness. The numerical results demonstrate that optimizing the first objective function reduced the total system cost to 6.96 billion dollars, while the optimization of the second objective function minimized the total energy consumption of the network to 6.86 terawatt hours. In addition, scenario analysis highlights the importance of energy consumption in enhancing efficiency and reducing supply chain costs.

This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel two-phase method for designing and optimizing a sustainable hybrid food-biofuel-bioenergy supply chain, incorporating the food-energy-water-health-pollution nexus. In the first phase, optimal locations for cultivating biomass resources (Jatropha and Microalgae) are determined using fuzzy methods within a Geographic Information System. The second phase develops a multi-objective mathematical optimization model that is solved by the Lp-metric method and validated through real-world data from Iran's food industry. The proposed network emphasizes sustainability through circular bio-economy practices, including wastewater recycling, food waste utilization, and replacing gasoil with biodiesel (20 % biodiesel, 80 % gasoil). Quantitative results demonstrate a 43 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, annual food products health improvements of 4 %, and efficient water resource management limiting increased water consumption to just 7 %.

However, the efficient production of HMF from cellulose is challenged by the complex interplay of numerous operational variables. This study develops a machine learning (ML) model to optimize HMF production and conducts a feature importance analysis to identify the key factors affecting HMF yield. Additionally, a Bayesian optimization is employed for multi-objective optimization aimed at maximizing HMF yield. A comprehensive dataset, sourced from existing literature, was subjected to statistical analysis to elucidate the influence of each factor on HMF production. Among the eight models evaluated, the CatBoost Regressor emerged as the most effective, delivering robust predictive performance with R2 of 0.76 during testing and exhibiting low RMSE (4.72) and MAE (5.2) values. Feature importance analysis revealed that operational conditions, particularly time and temperature, were the most significant, accounting for 41.0% of the variability, followed by catalyst properties at 33.0% and solvent properties at 26.0%.

These challenges demand simultaneous optimization of energy production, system reliability enhancement, and cost minimization including those related to fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, it is imperative to develop comprehensive models that address all these objectives. This paper proposes novel multi-objective and multi-level mathematical models tailored for Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRESs), facilitating the simultaneous consideration of diverse objectives and decision-making levels within renewable energy integration frameworks. To effectively tackle the complexity of these models, two efficient hybrid algorithms are introduced. The first algorithm employs a combined smoothing approach to address multi-level problems, leveraging Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions, mathematical principles, and heuristic functions to smooth the multi-level model. Additionally, Taylor approximation is employed to further refine the smoothed problem. The second algorithm, tailored for multi-objective models, operates in two phases: initially, a heuristic algorithm simplifies objective functions through interpolation; subsequently, the population is optimized using the Laying Chicken Algorithm (LCA), with a neural network refining the best LCA generation to identify the Pareto front in multi-objective problems. The proposed algorithms significantly improve system efficiency by optimizing the integration of diverse renewable energy sources and energy storage, leading to reduced operational costs and enhanced sustainability outcomes. These advancements offer promising real-world applications in optimizing energy systems, supporting the transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy infrastructure globally.

Against the backdrop of “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality,” agricultural biomass, as a vital renewable energy source, plays a key role in achieving economic and environmental sustainability through the rational allocation of supply quantities at storage points. This study focuses on the agricultural biomass supply chain and establishes a mathematical model encompassing three stages: field collection, storage, transportation, and the supply of solid biofuels. Using a multi-objective arithmetic optimization algorithm, the model aims to minimize economic costs and carbon emissions by optimizing supply allocations at storage points. Based on field data analysis from emerging biofuel enterprises, the optimized solution reduces total economic costs by 6.91 % (2.92 million yuan) and carbon emissions by 8.08 % (388.51 tons of CO<inf>2</inf>). Specific adjustments show a 64.72 % reduction in the supply from Lankao County, with increases of 67.16 % and 186.82 % in Bo'ai County and Linying County, respectively. Further analysis reveals that procurement and processing of agricultural biomass are the primary sources of economic costs, while carbon emissions mainly originate from the processing phase and long-distance transportation. Sensitivity analysis highlights the critical roles of key parameters, particularly the purchase price of biomass and the unit cost of processing and maintenance of solid biofuels, in influencing total costs.

This study investigates the combustion characteristics of pre-mixed various types of biomass fuels and the syngas they produce. The combustion modeling includes a detailed flame structure, covering drying, two-stage pyrolysis, and both heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions. The two-stage pyrolysis process consists of a primary stage that produces hydrogen-rich syngas and a secondary stage that decomposes tar. The associated governing equations and boundary conditions are solved analytically. Furthermore, to enhance combustion performance, the effect of methane addition to biomass-based fuels is analyzed. The findings indicate that an increase in equivalence ratio results in a greater amount of fuel in the reaction zone, leading to elevated flame temperatures and longer flame fronts. Upon examining different types of biomass combustion, plastic exhibited the highest flame temperature, while rice husk recorded the lowest. Additionally, the addition of methane results in higher burning rates and flame temperatures, with approximately 5.9 % and 13.23 % increases, respectively, in dual fuel (50 % biomass and 50 % methane) compared to mono biomass fuel.

This study aims to develop a multi-objective collaborative optimization model, using the Fen River Irrigation District as a case study. It examines strategies based on the water-energy-food-carbon nexus and seeks to maximize bioenergy production. The research methodology integrates multi-objective optimization theory with the ideal point method to obtain optimization solutions. This approach ensures the maximization of bioenergy output while minimizing carbon emissions and economic costs. The findings reveal that optimized bioenergy production in the study area can reach 1.17 × 1012 J, with contributions of 29.50 % from agriculture and 70.50 % from animal husbandry. Notably, animal husbandry emerges as the primary source of bioenergy production, generating 8.27 × 1011 J, predominantly from pigs, followed by sheep and cattle. The total optimized agricultural cultivation area is determined to be 6.76 × 104 ha, with corn taking the largest share at 73.86 % of the total cultivated area, which improves the economic benefits of agriculture while increasing the production of bioenergy. Fruits and vegetables account for 8.69 %, wheat for 3.45 %, and legumes for 13.99 %. In terms of the economic and environmental implications of bioenergy production, agriculture contributes more significantly to the agricultural economy compared to animal husbandry. Carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) emissions are the major contributor to overall carbon emissions, followed by methane (CH<inf>4</inf>). The optimized allocation of water resources results in a more reasonable ratio between surface water and groundwater supply, with 0.41 × 108 m3 coming from groundwater and 1.93 × 108 m3 from surface water, effectively alleviating the problem of regional water resources tension and guaranteeing the long-term stability of agricultural production. The optimization model focuses on generating solutions that conserve resources and reduce costs while simultaneously protecting the environment. This ultimately provides decision-makers with improved alternatives for managing agricultural resources. © 2025 The Authors","Bioenergy; Carbon emissions; Fen River irrigation district; Multi-Objective optimization model; Water-energy-food-carbon nexus"

We compare the use of three different many-objective evolutionary algorithms and linear programming in optimizing biomass cultivation decisions in the U.S. Corn Belt under weather uncertainty using historical, modeled, and synthetic yield data. We consider four feedstock choices (corn, soy, switchgrass, and algae) with two land types (agricultural and marginal lands) and evaluate decisions using three alternative spatial resolutions (ranging from the USDA agricultural district level to the state level). Results show that feedstock choice is the primary driver of objective performance (i.e., the position and shape of 3D, approximate Pareto frontiers).

Subsequently, the response surface methodology (RSM) desirability approach, along with a multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm (GA) approach, was employed to optimize the model and determine the optimal engine input parameters. The investigation revealed that the parametric combination obtained through the GA outperformed the RSM approach. The optimized engine responses were attained at the following input parameter settings: 99.70% engine load, 16.85 compression ratio, and a blend ratio of B20 (20% biodiesel and 80% diesel). At these optimal conditions, the engine exhibited remarkable performance and emissions characteristics. Specifically, the corresponding optimal engine responses for brake thermal efficiency, brake-specific fuel consumption, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and nitrogen oxides were observed as 33.85%, 281.27 g/kWh, 870 g/kWh, 0.811 g/kWh, and 2074 ppm volume, respectively.

This study optimises biodiesel production from waste cooking oil (WCO) using fuzzy modelling and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The optimisation process focuses on key input parameters: methanol quantity, reaction temperature, reaction time, and catalyst concentration, which were normalised and represented using linguistic variables. Fuzzy logic was employed to predict biodiesel yield, expressed in terms of linguistic variables, and defuzzified to yield crisp output values. The developed model achieved a high R2 value of 96.34%, demonstrating a strong correlation between input variables and biodiesel yield. The NSGA-II algorithm was utilised for multi-objective optimisation, determining the optimal conditions for biodiesel production: 150 ml of methanol, a reaction temperature of 62 °C, a reaction time of 63 min, and a catalyst concentration of 7.5 g.

This study emphasises the practical implications of optimised biodiesel production, such as reducing environmental pollution by recycling WCO and minimising reliance on fossil fuels. The optimised process meets ASTM standards and exhibits scalability potential for industrial-level production with minor modifications. The model’s robustness makes it suitable for integration into intelligent manufacturing systems, ensuring consistent biodiesel quality and yield through automated monitoring and control mechanisms. Despite its success, challenges such as feedstock variability and initial setup costs must be addressed.

However, the life cycle emissions and cost implications of these options are not clear. We present a multiobjective optimization framework for comparing cost- and emission-minimizing load-shifting strategies at a California case study facility with a relatively low carbon intensity grid and high spread in peak and off-peak electricity prices. We evaluate cost and emission trade-offs from the optimal flexible operation of both existing infrastructure and optimally sized energy flexibility upgrades. We estimate energy-related emission reductions of up to 9.0% with flexible operation of existing infrastructure and up to 16.8% with optimally sized storage upgrades. Only a fraction of these potential savings are realized under actual industrial energy tariffs and the EPA’s recommended social cost of carbon. Energy flexibility may hold promise as a short-term emission-saving solution for the wastewater sector, but the extent of savings is heavily dependent on the cost of carbon, electricity tariffs, and emission intensity of the regional electricity grid. © 2025 American Chemical Society.","climate; electricity; energy flexibility; load shifting; multiobjective optimization; wastewater"

Replacing fossil fuels with renewable sources of energy such as biofuel is crucial for a clean environment. In addition to its numerous advantages, the production of biofuels has detrimental effects on natural resources as well. Water, energy, and land are all required to produce food and energy, which are inextricably linked as the essential inputs for agriculture and fuel production. Undesirable climate change and its impacts on ecosystems are also consequences of this process. This study offers a two-phase approach to designing a canola-to-biodiesel supply chain. The first phase is concerned with finding appropriate sites for canola cultivation in accordance with climatic, social, economic and design criteria. To achieve an ideal solution, the fuzzy best-worst method and the fuzzy technique of order preference similarity to the ideal solution are simultaneously used. In the second phase, a new multi-objective integer programming model that involves a water-energy-food-land-ecosystem-undesirable climate change nexus is introduced. The suggested model enhances crop harvest from desirable agricultural areas, maximizes the profit, preserves ecosystem values, mitigates undesirable climate changes, and reduces water and energy consumption. An interactive fuzzy method is used to solve the model, and the efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated through a real case study for Iran. Sensitivity analyses are also performed on the key parameters. According to the findings, production activities are connected with the increase of network costs, adverse changes in climate, and increased use of energy. Thus, using high-yield catalysts, increasing the production scale, complying with environmental regulations, receiving government subsidies, investing in research to improve production technologies, and identifying cost-saving strategies can minimize harmful environmental effects and reduce biodiesel production costs, thereby boosting the profit. Furthermore, given Iran's water scarcity and reduced rainfall, increasing the canola yield per hectare might lead to less land use and water consumption for irrigation. Utilizing specialized machinery, enhancing farmers’ skills in canola cultivation, supplying seeds on time, planting promptly, providing optimal nutrition, and promoting pest management are all effective methods to boost canola yields. The insights provided in this study can help managers in the canola-based biodiesel production sector make better decisions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel; Biofuel supply chain; Canola; Multi-criteria decision-making; Multi-objective optimization; Nexus"

However, it does come with some challenges, such as varying quality and combustion properties. To enhance its performance, engines can be fine-tuned by adjusting fuel injection parameters, such as timing, pressure, and duration. Accordingly, this research article focuses on optimizing the fuel injection parameters for a CRDi engine powered by D+LPO (20% lemon peel oil and 80% diesel) biofuel, with the goal of improving both performance and emission characteristics. The experimental design matrix was generated using Design Expert-13 software, employing the I-optimal technique. Utilizing response surface methodology, a higher-order regression relationship is formulated for engine output performance and emissions response. The engine response matrix is developed with higher-order fit model (R2) for the entire operating speed and torque operations under various fuel injection operating points. The results obtained as, for better BTE, D+LPO maintained a higher quantity of pilot mass than diesel, which is identified as 22-26% for D+LPO and 10-16% for diesel.

The experimental setup includes testing different compression ratios (16, 17, 18) and loads (25 %, 50 %, 75 % torque) at a fixed speed of 1500 rpm, using Thai standard diesel as the control fuel. Biofuel variations tested include neat biodiesel, neat biokerosene, and blends of 30 % biokerosene with 70 % biodiesel and 50 % biokerosene with 50 % biodiesel. The results show that an increased compression ratio enhances combustion efficiency, reduces brake specific fuel consumption, and improves brake thermal efficiency, although it also leads to higher nitrogen oxide emissions. Biofuels improve brake thermal efficiency due to their higher oxygen content. However, the increased viscosity of biodiesel can hinder fuel atomization, resulting in higher emissions. In contrast, biokerosene improves brake thermal efficiency by facilitating earlier combustion and reducing emissions. Performance is primarily affected by load, while emissions are influenced by both biokerosene content and load. Gradient boosting models and optimization techniques, such as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) and adaptive geometry estimation-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (AGE-MOEA), produce consistent results, with AGE-MOEA identifying denser optimal points.

The objective of this project is to enhance the performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine that runs on biofuel by accurately calibrating its fuel injector control parameters. To achieve this goal, the project focuses on creating optimal split injector control maps using a novel global model-based calibration approach that considers the entire range of engine speed-load conditions. To develop the model, the experimentation was conducted using the I-optimal design of the experiment technique. To establish a relationship between the calibration parameters and engine performance parameters based on experimental data, the study employed response surface methodology (RSM). With the support of a developed model and multi-objective optimization approach under equivalent importance to performance and emissions, the optimum injector control points are derived. For the developed engine map for 20% KBD (Karanja bio-diesel)-blended fuel, the BTE (brake thermal efficiency) reaches up to 30% and lower BSFC (brake specific fuel consumption) of 0.37 kg/kW-hr. After optimization, the split injector control map showed significant improvements over the un-optimized map. At 19 Nm and 3000 rpm, the optimized map resulted in a 31.36% increase in BTE and a 29.31% decrease in BSFC. Moreover, the optimization successfully balanced the trade-off between reducing nitrogen oxide (NO<inf>x</inf>) emissions and smoke emissions. However, the optimized fuel map for 20% KBD-blended fuel shows slightly lower performance compared to diesel fuel. While the optimization process led to a decrease in smoke emissions about 22.3%, it also resulted in elevated NO<inf>x</inf> emissions about 9.83% when compared to diesel fuel. Furthermore, emissions of CO and HC are reduced by 12.8% and 19.2%, respectively, in an optimized control map of 20% KBD-blended fuel compared to un-optimized map. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.","Calibration; Injection control map, Multi-objective optimization; Karanja oil; Response surface methodology; Split injection"

In the present investigation, the critical fuel parameters of molecular weight, hydrogen-to-oxygen ratio, carbon-to-oxygen ratio, research octane number, energy content, and cooling potential were chosen based on their impact on the HCCI combustion load range limits. The support vector machine (SVM) regression models were developed to predict the HCCI engine characteristics, including combustion phasing, ISEC, and regulated emissions, using the above-mentioned critical fuel parameters as inputs. Experiment data obtained by running the HCCI engine using seven biofuels blended in gasoline consisted of 147 data points that trained the SVM models. The chosen biofuels belonged to distinct oxygenated organic functional groups of alcohol, ester, ether, and ketone. The relative importance of each key fuel parameter in predicting the investigated engine parameters was estimated. The robust SVM models were used in multi-objective Pareto-search optimization to find Pareto optimal solutions. TOPSIS was used to select the best alternative among 70 Pareto-optimal solutions for minimum ISEC and regulated emissions. The optimized fuel composition in the HCCI mode reduced the ISEC by 18% and NO<inf>x</inf> by 76% than the conventional diesel combustion mode. Also, the HCCI mode produced almost zero smoke emissions (< 0.0007 g/kW-h). The optimal fuel parameters could be achieved by tuning the biofuel proportions in gasoline.

Biofuels are significant substitutes for conventional fuels and decreases air pollution and carbon monoxide, can be made through a smart production system with automated machines. Biodiesel can be produced using an assortment of sources that can be both edible and inedible, but animal fat is a sensible alternative among inedible sources because of its affordable price and ease of availability. The model studies the smart biodiesel production system with energy utilization and less carbon emissions to produce pure biodiesel. The multi-objective mathematical model minimizes the total biodiesel supply chain cost followed by minimizing the total biodiesel supply chain environmental impact and enhancing its social impact. The smart production system with a variable production rate produces the biodiesel with less impurities, but still impurities in the biodiesel, that can be detected by a two-stage autonomated inspection system. The impure biodiesel is remanufactured in the biorefineries at the end of every natural production cycle. For the best utilization of energy, various energy costs, such as lighting and air handling costs are calculated. The improved augmented ϵ-constraint approach with lexicographic optimization is utilized to solve the model. The four mathematical examples are studied, and the repercussions of mathematical experiments reveal that the animal fat purchasing cost is 44.32% of the total cost, and the percentage of impurities in biodiesel can be decreased through minimum energy consumption.

Wood biomass, in particular, can improve air quality by reducing the smoke created by burning woody biomass. In this research, our key objective is to model the wood biomass supply chain to promote the effective operation of biofuel. Initially, we propose the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model with multiple objectives for assessing the biofuel supply chain. Next, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is applied to assess uncertain data from decision makers and integrated with the proposed mathematical model. The developed model evaluates the perspective of sustainability by considering total cost – the surrogate criterion for the economic aspect, unsatisfied demand – the surrogate criterion for the social aspect, and CO2 emission – the surrogate criterion for the environmental aspect, into account. Next, both the supply of wood biomass from each farm node and the demand for produced electricity are evaluated with probabilistic scenarios and stochastic analysis in our analysis.

This study establishes an economic-environmental-resource synergistic Straw Green recycling optimization model based on straw-electricity-biochar-biogas core (Straw Green recycling optimization model, SGROM). Firstly, we explore the effects of biochar return to the field on crop yield and greenhouse gas emission by Meta-analysis method, and on this basis, we construct SGROM to weigh the three objectives of economic-greenhouse gas emission-resource utilization, and explore the best allocation ratio between four utilization methods of straw: power generation, biochar preparation, biogas and derivatives preparation and sale, so as to obtain a straw recycling and efficient low-carbon utilization model. Exploring the response of straw green utilization patterns to crop market prices with the help of deep learning methods, SGROM has been applied to the main grain producing areas in the Sanjiang Plain of China, and the results of comparison with the traditional straw utilization (TSU) model show that the greenhouse gas emissions per unit of production value of SGROM are 19.66 % lower than that of TSU model, the electricity consumption is saved by 2.00 %, and the optimal ratios of straw for power generation, biogas and biochar production, and sale are 1.00 %, 10.75 %, 62.11 % and 26.14 %.

The water-energy-food-land Nexus approach (WEFL Nexus) supports integrated production planning of natural resources and promotes sustainability. In Brazil, sugarcane ethanol production is considered one of the biofuel nation's solutions to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Ethanol production constitutes a renewable and sustainable energy source. This research analyzes the efficiency and sustainability of the Brazilian ethanol supply chain, comparing a conventional scenario focusing only on economic efficiency (restricted to first-generation ethanol production) with another scenario considering WEFL Nexus objectives (and first and second-generation ethanol production). The study developed a multi-objective mathematical model to analyze the supply chain efficiency, combined with a multi-criteria decision approach analysis. The results indicate a gain in efficiency and sustainability with the second-generation manufacturing plants. In the Nexus scenario, supply chain efficiency increased due to the 35.63 % additional production of second-generation ethanol and the 2.94 % manufacturing cost minimization. Also, the Nexus scenario met sustainable and social demands that were not fulfilled by the non-Nexus scenario.

The integration of various processes yielding different bioproducts has been encouraged to increase profitability and overall sustainability through algal biorefineries. Moreover, considering the goal to minimize waste, resource recirculation can be maximized to achieve economic and environmental sustainability.

Experimental data based on central composite design (CCD) were used to train a feed-forward multilayer ANN with four critical parameters.

The RSM approach is used in this study to reduce the number of experimental tests and costs. In the RSM technique, the three input operational parameters such as injection pressures (30, 35, and 40 MPa), engine loads through indicated mean effective pressure (2.1, 4.15, and 6.2 bar), and varying waste plastic oil (WPO)-diesel fuel blends (5%, 10%, and 15%) are considered to improve the engine output responses like brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. The polynomial regression model is developed within the defined input parameter range. The validations and prediction accuracy of the regression model are studied using diagnostic and influence plots such as Box-Cox, Cook's distance, leverage plot, and difference in fits (DFFITS) analysis, to name a few. After the validations of the model, the prediction values of BTE and NOx are compared with the experimental test results. The effects of input parameters on the BTE and NOx emissions are studied by contour and 3D surface plots. The collective effect of NOx and BTE is analysed through an overlay plot at different one-side intervals. The minor change in the outputs of BTE and NOx emissions is studied by sensitivity analysis. The confirmation of the proposed regression model is done through the multi-variate desirability function approach. The results found that the regression model predicts accurately when compared to the experimental test results.

Animal fat-based biodiesel is a sensible alternative to non-renewable energy sources as it's produced from inedible, affordable, and easily available biomass. The effective design of a biodiesel supply chain is pivotal for making it more advantageous than fossil fuels from a social, economic, and environmental standpoint. This model reduces the biodiesel supply chain cost while minimizing its environmental impact and maximizing its social impact. It is planned to have multi-supply sites for providing beef, chicken, and mutton fat, and numerous biorefineries, rendering factories, and distribution depots. The augmented ϵ-constraint approach combined with the lexicographic optimization technique is used to solve the multi-objective optimization model. A numerical example is analyzed, and the results show that the environmental impact of establishing biodiesel production facilities is 99.5% of the environmental impact of the entire biodiesel supply chain and that the cost of installing biodiesel production plants is 99% of the cost of the entire biodiesel supply chain. A heterogeneous fleet of trucks is incorporated to distribute the material throughout the supply chain whereby the impact of transportation on the environment is 0.0007% of the total environmental impact of the biodiesel supply chain and transportation cost amount to 0.0014% of the total costs of the biodiesel supply chain.

Considering that traditional support vector machine training relies on initial parameters and is prone to local convergence, a genetic algorithm model is adopted to construct an improved diesel engine pre-emission model. At the same time, with the optimization goal of diesel engine emissions of particles and gases, the improved diesel engine pre-emission model is used to obtain emission data as training parameters. The second generation non-dominated genetic algorithm is introduced to construct a multi-objective diesel engine emission control model, achieving optimal control of diesel engine emissions. In the experimental analysis of diesel engine pre emission models, the proposed pre emission model has a better prediction effect in nitrogen oxides, with an average prediction accuracy of 0.986, which is better than the Particle Swarm Optimization-Support Vector Machine model's 0.906, and is more accurate in detecting emissions. Simultaneously predicting particulate matter, the average prediction accuracy of the proposed model is 0.978, while the prediction accuracy of the Particle Swarm Optimization-Support Vector Machine model is 0.902, indicating that the overall prediction effect of the proposed method is better. In the experimental analysis of multi-objective optimization models, the proposed multi-objective optimization model performs best in diesel emission optimization. The proposed model can achieve convergence in the shortest time, and the minimum nitrogen oxide emissions are 210.7 ppm. Compared with Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization models, the particle emission optimization effect is improved by 23.5 % and 18.6 %. From this, it can be seen that the proposed method has excellent performance in diesel engine emission monitoring and pollutant optimization, surpassing related technologies in the same period.

Consequently, the pursuit of clean and efficient energy alternatives, as well as enhancements in the combustion of fossil fuels, have emerged as potential avenues for resolving these challenges. Firstly, a 3D simulation model of the engine is made using the CONVERGE program. Then, the biodiesel-hydrogen (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%) blends are employed to investigate the combustion processes for the diesel-fuel engine at various loading (50%, 75%, and 100%). Finally, the response surface approach is employed to optimize the biodiesel-hydrogen engines' combustion and emission parameters. The findings demonstrate that combustion pressure and temperature in engine cylinders will also rise as the hydrogen level increases. The hydrogen addition to the engine can enhance its combustion and emission properties. The outcomes prove that 0.656 is the ideal value for multi-objective optimization analysis using the response surface method.

Currently, biodiesel and ethanol are the two biofuels that are blended with fossil fuels. Another technology, namely, hydroprocessing, is also gaining momentum for producing biofuels. Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) produced using this process is a potential drop-in fuel due to its improved physiochemical properties. This study aimed to reduce the fossil diesel content by blending 20% and 30% HVO and 5%, 10% and 15% waste cooking oil biodiesel on a volume basis. The blends were used to conduct a thorough performance examination of a single-cylinder compression ignition engine. The thermal efficiency of the engine was enhanced by the addition of biodiesel to the blend. The efficiency increased as the proportion of biodiesel in the mix increased, although it was still less efficient than diesel. The maximum improvement in thermal efficiency of 4.35% was observed with 20% blending of HVO and 15% blending of biodiesel compared with 20% blending of HVO and diesel. However, the HC (decrease of 30%), CO (decrease of 23.5%) and smoke (decrease of 21.1%) emissions were observed to be the lowest with 30% blending of HVO and 15% blending of biodiesel. A fuzzy-logic-based Taguchi method and Grey’s method were then applied to find the best blend of HVO, biodiesel and diesel. The combination of the two methods made it easier to carry out multi-objective optimization. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE), smoke and NO emissions were selected as the output parameters to optimize the HVO and biodiesel blend. The optimization study showed that 30% blending of HVO and 15% blending of biodiesel was the best blend, which was authenticated using the confirmation experiment. © 2023 by the authors.","fuzzy logic; hydrotreated oil; Taguchi method; ternary blends; used cooking oil biodiesel"

The GL pyrolysis was divided into three stages, with the main stage occurring between 205 and 630 °C. The activation energy for the main stage was estimated at 221.23 kJ/mol and 222.83 kJ/mol according to the FWO and KAS methods, respectively.

But depending on one particular species of feedstock will lead to its extinction like diesel. For this intent, this research proposes a novelty on blending of binary non-edible high oil yielding species. As biodiesel is a natural constituent with elevated oxygen content, a stability analysis has to be performed to diminish its rapid decay. For stabilizing fuel properties synthetic antioxidants have been involved as inhibitors. Previous studies have been performed on the stability analysis individually as oxidation, thermal and storage stability without analyzing them mutually. This research fills the key gap by deeper mutual stability analysis, as the output parameters of these three stabilities are interrelated. Few samples have shown best stability output parameters which challenges in narrowing the best blend. To face this task, a multi objective optimization study has been done. NO<inf>x</inf> emission has been reduced with the aid of antioxidants as a twin reward.

A 3.5 kW engine with compression ratios values ranging from 18:1 to 22:1 and SC pressures of 0, 0.25, and 0.5 bar (g) at 80% load was considered. The inlet manifold pressure was controlled using a centrifugal-type blower (1.5 m3/min, 350 W, 240 V AC) with an adjustable valve. Key fuel energy parameters including shaft energy, cylinder pressure, brake specific energy consumption, thermal efficiency, heat release rate, absorbed energy by cooling water, exhaust gas temperature, exergy efficiency, exergy destruction, exhaust energy, and emissions were analyzed. Results showed significant improvements in shaft energy (35.51%), thermal efficiency (35.37%), and heat release rate (25.17 J/°CA) for compression ratios 20 and supercharging pressure of 0.25 bar, with a reduction in brake specific energy consumption of 2.912 kJ/s kW.

To achieve sustainable development goals and prevent harmful climate scenarios, the world needs to increase its use of renewable energy. Biodiesel, a clean and eco-friendly fuel with a high flash point and more lubrication than petroleum-based fuels, and without the emission of harmful environmental gases, has emerged as one of the fossil fuel alternatives. To promote the mass-level production of biodiesel, a sustainable supply chain (SC) that does not depend on laboratory production is necessary. For this purpose, this research proposes a multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear mathematical programming (MINLP) model to design a sustainable canola oil-based biodiesel supply chain network (CO-BSCND) under supply and demand uncertainty. This mathematical model aims to minimize the total cost (TC) and total carbon emission while maximizing the total number of job opportunities simultaneously. A scenario-based robust optimization (SBRO) approach is applied to deal with uncertainty. The proposed model is implemented in a real case study in Iran, and numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis are conducted to demonstrate its applicability. The results of this research demonstrate that designing a sustainable supply chain network for the production and distribution of biodiesel fuel is achievable. Moreover, this mathematical modeling makes mass-scale production of biodiesel fuel a possibility. In addition, the SBRO method adopted in this research enables managers and researchers to explore the design conditions of the supply chain network by controlling the uncertainties that affect it. This approach allows the chain’s performance to be as close as possible to the actual conditions. As a result, the SBRO method enhances the efficiency of the supply chain network and boosts productivity toward achieving desired goals. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biodiesel; Carbon emission; Robust optimization; Supply chain network design; Sustainability; Uncertainty"

Most of these wastes end up in landfills and incineration, causing significant environmental problems that are detrimental to human health and other species on the Earth. Thermochemical conversion can solve this issue by utilizing the energy embedded inside the biomass, mainly organic matter, into high-grade fuels and chemicals. Fast pyrolysis is one of the technologies that can convert biomass waste to a high yield of bio-oil, which can then be used as biofuels in vehicles. In this study, palm oil biomass wastes are valorized to generate bio-oil sustainably via several pyrolysis technologies such as conventional pyrolysis, microwave pyrolysis, and thermo-catalytic pyrolysis in a multi-objective optimization framework. The formulated multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming problems are solved using the ɛ-constraint method. The Pareto-optimal solutions have illustrated a clear trade-off between two conflicting objectives: total annualized profit and the global warming potential. The most profitable solution economically has an annualized profit of $237 per ton of biomass with an emission of 628 kg CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent per ton of biomass. On the other hand, the most environmentally sustainable solution, while still generating positive income, has an annualized profit of $122 per ton of biomass with an emission of 132 kg CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent per ton of biomass. A second scenario with a case study presented on the palm oil industry in Malaysia has also demonstrated the selection of biomass during feedstock blending when a constraint on biomass feedstock availability is pre-defined. The proposed model is robust for planning bioenergy complex, especially those involving multiple biomass feedstocks. In fact, this study has addressed the research gap in comparison of multiple distinctive pyrolysis processes with respect to multiple palm biomass feedstocks. © 2023, The Author(s).","Biogenic waste; Biomass; Multi-objective optimization; Palm oil; Pyrolysis; Waste-to-energy"

The social dimension is thus often implemented only rudimentarily, thwarting a holistic sustainability assessment and neglecting many of the social issues addressed in the sustainable development goals (SDGs). This work presents a structured process for including a comprehensive set of social aspects by selecting applicable quantitative and regionalized social indicators. This approach is applied to the case of second-generation bioethanol production in the EU. Based on inter alia the Guidelines for Social Life Cycle Assessment of Products and Organizations, the Social Hotspots Database, state-of-the-art literature, as well as previous work, we compile 9 social objective functions and 25 functions for social hotspot identification. They are evaluated alongside 1 economic and 21 environmental LCA-based objective functions in a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. Key results show that social optimization either leads to large, labor-intensive or regionally focused, indicator-driven networks. Injuries and fatalities in the feedstock sectors of Central and Eastern European countries is the primary social hotspot. On the level of the overarching SDGs, SDG13 is most congruent with other goals, while SDG7 is hindered by pursuing other goals. This study's approach is novel in strategic network design and the European bioeconomy, and, by operationalizing the social dimension, enables a more holistic life cycle sustainability assessment and the consideration of the SDGs.

Toward this, a supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle is employed at first, and the remaining waste heat boosts a flash-binary geothermal cycle. Consequently, the operation of the geothermal cycle and its waste heat recovery quality is strengthened.

This procedure is based on the two-stage network data envelopment analysis (TSN-DEA) models that have been developed to provide specific process guidance for the managers to improve the efficiency of the decision-making unit (DMU) with the TSN process. The crucial issue of the TSN-DEA is that the overall efficiency score depends on the DMUs under evaluation. Thus, the rankings for the DMUs generated by the TSN-DEA model are inconsistent. As a result, the TSN-DEA-based ranking methods are limited. The TSN-DEA’s inconsistency frequently makes it difficult for decision-makers to select the top-rated DMUs. We develop the transformed TSN (T-TSN) DEA method by applying the multi-criteria DEA model to overcome this issue. The proposed method transforms the DMUs with any number of inputs, intermediate measures, and outputs in the TSN process, through the multi-objective programming model with a minimax objective approach, into the DMUs with two inputs and one output in the single-stage network (SSN) process. Then, the well-known DEA methods for the SSN, such as the cross-efficiency and super-efficiency DEA methods, can be applied to evaluate and rank the transformed DMUs more consistently. We exhibit the applicability of the proposed approach for the BBLN design problem. A case study of South Carolina in the USA demonstrates that the proposed method performs well in identifying efficient BBLN schemes more consistently than the traditional TSN-DEA. © 2023, Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Biomass-biofuel logistics network; data envelopment analysis; decision-making unit; efficiency score; multiple criteria; two-stage network"

In this domain, one main challenge concerns multi scale modeling to accurately integrate the different decision scales (from strategic to operational) and to study the impact of the decision across these scales, in order to effectively contributes to intelligent and coherent decision making. Unfortunately, very few papers cover the three decision levels - strategic (long-term decisions: supply network design), tactical (medium-term decisions: management of network design) and operational (short- term decisions: routing, inventory management…) to have a holistic perspective of the supply chain. Therefore, the first objective of this paper is to model as finely as possible the three decision levels by focusing more particularly on the transport related decision due to their importance on the supply chain performances. As a progress, the Vehicle Routing Problem, one of the most studied problem in logistic and one of the most complex, is integrated into a strategic and tactical model. But, the resulting large-scale MILP model must be solved in a reasonable computational time. To achieve this second objective, we developed a novel iterative multi scale strategy that optimizes the model at two spatial and two temporal scales. This strategy is based on a deep knowledge of the mathematical models and especially of the variables that strongly influence the resolution. The real biofuel supply chain in the Ethiopian country is used to demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, and the improvement in computing time and solution strategy. In addition to the change in the design of the supply chain network, the use of an operational model that finely describes the transport activities shows that the costs related to these activities are often underestimated by a factor between 2 and 3 in the classical models of the literature. The main perspectives of this work are to address the two main shortcomings of the proposal: writing and solving in a reasonable computational time a single model rather than using a decomposition (especially useful for multi-objective optimization) and integrating other decisions at the operational level to not be limited to those related to transportation. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Bioethanol; Multi scale; Optimization; Supply chain"

The quality of biomass pellets is sensitive to the pelletization conditions. Consequently, in this work the impact of the operating parameters as applied pressure, die temperature, and moisture content on the physical properties of solid and hollow pellets as pellet length (L<inf>p</inf>), normal volume expansion (V<inf>exp, n</inf>), initial and relaxed pellet densities (ρ<inf>p, i</inf> and ρ<inf>p, rel</inf>), moisture content of pellet (M<inf>p</inf>), water absorption rate (k), and absorption volume expansion (V<inf>exp, ab</inf>) of rice straw (RS) pellets was studied. Furthermore, the synergic effect of these parameters on the pellet properties was evaluated at the optimum conditions. The operating parameters were optimized using a multi-objective optimization approach of response surface method (RSM) based on the predicted significant models that describe the physical properties of the pellets. The optimization results showed that high-quality pellets could be produced at a pressure of 72.76 MPa, temperature of 110°C, and moisture of 7.23% for solid pellets and 81.5 MPa, 109°C, and 7.72% for hollow pellets.

These relationships can be generalized to any type of pellets that are produced under various operating conditions. Hollow pellets are recommended being used in the industrial sector due to their enhanced heat transfer which resulted from the high surface to volume ratio besides their ease of production at normal operating condition similar to that required for solid pellets.

This current study was conducted through an advanced injection strategy called the split injection approach, followed by various energy shares from ethanol or CNG enrichment through port fuel injection strategies. Hence the engine operation was conducted with the fuel mixture of various reactivity in different proportions.

In this context, third-generation biodiesel has emerged as a promising and cleaner alternative for the transportation sector, gaining widespread attention due to its environmental and social benefits. However, ensuring the sustainable and efficient production and delivery of biodiesel to the market requires an optimal supply chain management strategy, encompassing a coordinated effort by all stakeholders involved. This paper presents a novel multi-objective decision support model for managing a multi-echelon third-generation biodiesel supply chain comprising a biomass producer, a biorefinery, and multiple retailers. The proposed model leverages a multi-objective non-linear optimization framework, incorporating economic and environmental objectives to achieve a balance between profitability and sustainability. The economic performance of the model is analyzed using an uncertain activity-based costing approach and a single-setup-multi-delivery policy, while carbon emissions are reduced at every stage of the supply chain to enhance environmental performance. To deal with the uncertainties in the decision-making parameters, a robust possibilistic programming-based solution methodology is employed, providing optimality and feasibility robustness to the obtained solutions. Furthermore, a weighted goal programming approach is adopted to achieve an optimal trade-off between the conflicting objectives of the model, and the NP-hard problem is solved using a metaheuristic approach. The practical applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated through an experimental study, and the performance of the numerical outcomes is analyzed under varying decision-maker preferences and sensitivity analysis. The experimental findings indicate that SSMD reduces the total cost of the system. The proposed approach can be used to evaluate the environmental, economic, and technological factors that can enhance supply chain management performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Biofuel supply chain management; Environmental protection; Renewable energy; Robust possibilistic programming; Single-setup-multi-delivery policy"

In Sweden, a country rich in forests and with a long tradition in intensive forest management, such systems have been developed and available since the 1970s. Changes in societal as well as in forest owners’ preferences and objectives in the 1990s led to a need for forest DSS handling broader perspectives compared to precedent single-objective timber-oriented systems. In Sweden, this led to the initiation of a research programme in the beginning of the 2000s aiming at developing a versatile and multi-objective forest DSS, resulting in the first version of the Heureka forest DSS released in 2009. The system handles several forest values, such as timber and biofuel production, carbon sequestration, dead wood dynamics, habitat for species, recreation and susceptibility to forest damages (spruce bark beetle, wind-throw and root rot). It contains a suite of software for different problem settings and geographical scales and uses simulation as well as optimization techniques. Three software handle projections of the forest using a common core of growth and yield models for simulating forest dynamics. A fourth software, built for multi-criteria decision analysis and including a web-version, enables also group decision making and participatory planning. For more than 10 years, the Heureka system has been used in teaching, environmental analysis, research and as decision support in practical forestry. For example, several research groups using the system for analyses in different problem areas have so far published more than 80 scientific papers. The system is used for nation-wide forest impact analysis for policy support and all large and many medium-sized forest owners use it for their long-term forest planning, meaning that it directly influences forest management decisions and activities on more than 50% of the Swedish forest area. Besides presenting the present system and its use, we also discuss lessons learned and potential future development. © © 2023 Lämås, Sängstuvall, Öhman, Lundström, Årevall, Holmström, Nilsson, Nordström, Wikberg, Wikström and Eggers.","computer system; ecosystem services; forest management planning; multi criteria decision analysis; multi-objective forest planning; optimization; simulation; trade-offs"

Objectives: To optimize the environmental impact and economic profitability of utilization of biofuel production from the EFB fast pyrolysis process. Materials & Methods: The biodiesel power plant from the EFB fast pyrolysis process was modelled using the Aspen Plus program and optimized using the MATLAB program. The multi-objective teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm was used to maximize the net present value (NPV) while minimizing the CO<inf>2</inf> emission of a biodiesel power plant in each case. Results: The optimization results showed that the best case from the economic aspect was an NPV of USD million 14.233 with 59,755 t CO<inf>2</inf>/yr, while the best case in terms of minimizing environmental impact was with the lowest CO<inf>2</inf> emission equivalent of 58,770 t CO<inf>2</inf>/yr and an NPV of USD million 12.008. The difference between these two scenarios regarding the CO<inf>2</inf> emission was slight (1.65%), while for the NPV, it was high (15.63%). Main finding: Both cases produced higher CO<inf>2</inf> emissions than from direct combustion. However, they were still environmentally friendly since they reduced the CO<inf>2</inf> emission equivalent compared to using the EFB as landfill and produced valuable products, while enhancing energy conservation by up to 100 kW. © © 2023.","Aspen Plus process modeling; Empty fruit bunches; Multi-objective teaching-learning based optimization; Pyrolysis process"

Biofuel is viewed as a viable alternative to non-renewable energy sources for energy generation. Animal fat, waste cooking oil, and vegetable oil are all examples of biomass that can be utilized to make biodiesel. In the midst of these sources’ animal fat is an acceptable choice due to its cheap cost and convenience of availability. The multi-objective mathematical optimization model is created to plan a sustainable supply chain for biodiesel made from waste animal fat. The proposed model minimizes the biodiesel supply chain cost, furthermore, minimizing the environmental impact while maximizing social impact. The demand for biodiesel is depending on advertisement costs and subsidies provided by the government. The advertisements promote biodiesel as an alternative to fossil fuels, and the government gives a subsidy for the collection of waste animal fat. The improved “augmented ϵ-constraint approach” is used to solve the proposed model. The multiple supply points for beef, mutton, and chicken fat, multi-collection and rendering plants, multiple biorefineries, and biodiesel depositories are designed. A numerical example is analyzed, and the consequences of a numerical experiment uncover that the transportation cost is 51.34% and installation cost of biodiesel production facilities accounts for 21.26% of the total cost, and the environmental installation impact of biodiesel production facilities accounts for 99.94% of total environmental impact. In the transportation sector, the heterogeneous fleet of trucks is employed to supply materials in the entire supply chain by which environmental transportation impacts account for 0.0005% of total environmental impacts. The social impact is examined by the social impact assessment method focused on life cycle assessment which is 1.363% for this model. The designed model can be appropriate to policymakers and investors engaged in the biodiesel industry. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Advertisement; Augmented ɛ-constraint approach; Social responsibility; Sustainable biodiesel supply chain; Waste animal fat"

It is among the renewable energy sources that are utilized to replace fossil-fuel-based energy. Designing an efficient, Sustainable Bioethanol Supply Chain Network (SBSCN) is a critical task for the government and communities to manage the bioethanol demands appropriately. The contribution of this study is threefold. First, this study project the demand using three popular machine learning methods, including Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Ensemble Learning (Adaboost) methods, to find the best one to be utilized as an input to the proposed mathematical to find optimal values for strategic, planning, and tactical decision variables.

Due to the sensitivity of two meta-heuristics algorithms, the Taguchi method, such as Max Spread (MS) and Mean Ideal Distance (MID), is utilized to control the parameters of those two applied algorithms. Since North Dakota (ND) is among the states with the most potential to produce bioethanol due to its vast land area, including marginal cropland and Conservation Research Program (CRP), the proposed model has been evaluated and validated based on the ND case study. The results show that the MOIWO algorithm outperforms NSGA-II based on the proposed model and the case study of this paper. Also, this algorithm is more reliable in terms of solution quality to tackle the problem.

The powertrain parameters are defined as design variables, along with the membership functions, rules, and weights of the fuzzy logic controllers, responsible for the power split among the four in-wheel electric motors, the engine and generator operation. The optimization is done under the combination of four standard driving cycles combined in a 4 times loop, resulting in a 281.8 km path.

Jatropha (Jatropha Curcas L.) is known as one of the most appropriate feedstocks used for the biofuel production. Since finding the optimal Jatropha cultivation site is the first step to produce biofuel, this study proposes a hybrid approach based on Geographic Information System (GIS) and decision-making techniques to assess most suitable Jatropha cultivation sites under uncertain conditions, to produce methyl-based biofuel in Fars province, Iran. In order to consider uncertain conditions in this research, fuzzy theory is used in decision-making techniques. To this aim, fuzzy best–worst method (FBWM) is employed to calculate the weight of sub-criteria, and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and fuzzy multi-objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis (MOORA) methods are used to rank suitable locations. The results indicate that 4% of the total study area, equal to 490,432 ha, mostly located in the southern zones of the study area, which can provide 59% of total produced Jatropha, is highly suitable for Jatropha planting. This research also indicates that Larestan and Zarrindasht, located in the southern half of Fars province, are the optimal places to cultivate Jatropha. These two counties have mostly warm and dry climate with more sunshine, which makes them appropriate for growing Jatropha. It is determined that approximately 3.9 million tons of Jatropha seeds can be harvested annually, which leads to produce 1.18 million tons of biofuel in Fars province per year. Ultimately, the variability of the final results in relation to the changes in the input data is examined through five different scenarios and the amount of Jatropha and biofuel produced in each scenario is reported.

The use of eucalyptus oil as biodiesel in compression ignition (CI) engines shows promising results under numerous conditions, with properties such as high volatility and low viscosity and it innately emits lesser emissions during combustion. In a fully accelerated engine setup, key factors such as the performance and emissions of the engine are optimized using statistical techniques. The research involves a structured approach to investigating the capability of a 20% volumetric blend of eucalyptus oil (Eu20) mixed in diesel and is compared with a diesel under commensurable conditions. The ordered experimentations are performed on a common rail direct injection (CRDi) engine setup using the central composite design (CCD) along with Response Surface Methodology and desirability tests for easier calibration. All the optimal engine inputs are obtained from the developed multivariate regression model. Interaction effects are employed to identify the most influential factor through monitoring the interaction of two specific input factors on a single response. From the desirability tests, predicted with the highest desirability of 0.974, the optimal responses recorded are brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of 16.766%, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of 0.516 kg/kW-hr, carbon monoxide (CO) of 0.17%, hydrocarbon (HC) of 16.22 ppm and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) of 77.565 ppm. Moreover, confirmatory tests are performed on the engine with responses having an error below 8%. From this experimentation, it has been found that the heating value of eucalyptus oil leads to lower BTE and higher fuel consumption rate even after the optimization. So that, to enhance the performance characteristics of the engine, the zirconium oxide (ZrO<inf>2</inf>) nanoparticles are mixed with the Eu20 at 50 and 100 ppm concentrations. While testing for the optimized parametric condition, the nanoparticle mixture sample delivers enhanced thermal efficiency and reduced fuel consumption rate than the Eu20. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuel; Desirability; Eucalyptus oil; Interaction effect; Multi-objective optimization; Nano additive"

The aim of this work was to introduce and examine an optimization model for maximizing the power generation of Al Ghabawi landfill in Amman city, Jordan. The optimization process focused on studying the effect of several operating parameters within the landfill power plant. To achieve this goal, a combustion model had been built and validated against a set of historical real data obtained from the landfill operator. In addition to that, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model had been built to perform a multi-objective optimization to obtain the optimal power generation conditions for Al Ghabawi landfill. The combustion model along with the ANN model aim to estimate the best engine operating conditions based on the actual daily data of the landfill. The engine operating parameters includes the intake pressure and temperature, the ignition time and the equivalence ratio. The results of the study indicate that the current operating parameters can be optimized to maximize the gensets power generation. Based on the daily data of the produced LFG, the optimal operating conditions for the landfill are 2.32 bar for the intake pressure, 303 K for the intake temperature, 0.9–1.0 for the equiveillance ratio and for the ignition time it is 13 degrees before the top dead center (BTDC).

The method is demonstrated for a case study plant in Bangalore, India, using onsite kitchen waste to provide biogas for cooking. The AD system is modelled using Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) and a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to control the substrate feeding rate in order to simultaneously minimise the volume of flared biogas, unmet gas demand and energy cost. Our results show that ADM1 can predict biogas yield from a continuously operated digester well with mean percentage errors between daily predicted and measured data values of only 5.7% for March 2017 and 17.8% for July 2017. When biogas flaring and unmet gas demand were minimised, the amount of biogas flared reduced from 886.62 m3 to 88.87 m3 in March and from 73.79 m3 to 68.49 m3 in July. When the energy cost was also considered within the objective function, the biogas flared reduced from 886.62 m3 to 281.27 m3 for March, but increased from 73.79 m3 to 180.11 m3 for July. The amount of flaring increased in July as the energy cost function increased biogas yield without considering surplus gas production beyond demand and storage capacity.

Efficient biofuel production requires the optimal supply chain design and the planning of complex production operations in biorefineries. The biomass processing is capacity constrained due to design restrictions. The limitation on the production capacity corresponding to a selected technology restricts the maximum production from the most profitable process. In such a scenario, the production plan involves the use of less profitable processes to satisfy the demand, resulting in a sub-optimal solution. This article proposes a multi-unit, multi-period supply chain model to overcome the restriction in plant capacity by establishing multiple units of a profitable process. The multi-objective optimization study of the proposed model has been demonstrated on a case study from the literature that requires the design of supply chain for bioenergy. The proposed formulation leads to solutions with better economic and social benefits than those reported in the literature. The multi-unit model provides a solution which has a 4.73% increase in profit and generates 78 additional jobs for a horizon of 12 months. The optimal network design has contributed to several key findings, such as the breakeven point of the raw materials with respect to the profit and the dual relationship between profit and the number of jobs generated. The study also analyzes the effect of multiple units and variations of demand on the proposed model. The multi-unit model is able to determine a solution with 3.96% improvement in profit even with a reduction in the demand by 50%.

This has contributed to an increasing recognition of biodiesel as an alternative combustible. This combustible is produced by a process of chemical transesterification. The study investigates modelling and optimal conditions for biodiesel production. It is based on five input process parameters that cause the greater environmental impact when employing used cooking oil. These input parameters are the methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst dose, reaction temperature, reaction time and stirred speed. Biodiesel yield, high heating value and energy consumption also were considered to be output process variables, whereas global warming, acidification, human toxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity and fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity were considered to be environmental impacts of the process. The effect on the environment of various input process parameters is often determined by life cycle assessment. Current paper provides a novel optimization of biodiesel production from waste cooking oil using multi-response surface methodology and life cycle assessment. It improves a new optimal sustainability production of biodiesel by combining the input process parameters, while minimizing the environmental impacts of the process. Four different optimization scenarios were proposed. The first scenario is one with a higher yield and higher heating value, but requires less catalyst and a lower methanol to oil molar ratio, as well as the power necessary for the chemical process. The second scenario attempts to minimize the environmental impact of the process on global warming, acidification, human toxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity and fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, while minimizing the methanol to oil molar ratio and the catalyst dose. In addition to considering the input process parameters and environmental impacts in the second scenario, the third scenario minimizes the power that the chemical process requires. Finally, the fourth scenario considered the same input process parameters and environmental impact as the third scenario in an effort to minimize the reaction time of the process. This fourth scenario was the one of least environmental impact in the production of biodiesel (global warming = 0.351768 kg CO<inf>2</inf> eq.; human toxicity = 0.103402 kg 1.4-BD eq. and fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity = 0.027826 kg 1.4-BD eq.), in an efficient way ((η = 0.91374) while the calorific value of biodiesel obtained was high 42.466742 MJ/kg).

In this contribution, the performance of the RD column is enhanced by process intensification and optimization. A multi-objective optimization (MOO) strategy is framed for optimizing the RD column for three conflicting objectives. For this MOO, the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is employed. From the obtained Pareto-optimal front, one optimal solution for RD design is selected using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) with entropy information for weighting of objectives. To further reduce the environmental impact and optimal usage of internal energy, a novel thermally coupled reactive distillation (TCRD) column is suggested. Finally, a biodiesel production unit is developed by integrating a decanter with the TCRD column, to produce biodiesel product of 99.45 wt.% purity.

Developed systems include two integrated systems in one of them a vanadium chloride cycle is used to produce hydrogen from biogas and the other a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEME) is used. Both suggested systems are integrated with a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and an anaerobic digester (AD). A parametric investigation is performed on the systems to determine the effects of changing parameters such as solid oxide fuel cell temperature, fuel cell working pressure, current density, and utilization factor the thermodynamic, economic, and environmental performance of the systems. Findings indicated that the current density of 0.54 was about 5.5 % higher than the system with electrolysis, while the cost rate of the system was 22% percent lower. With the change of SOFC temperature from 900 K to 1300 K, the results showed that in 1000 K, the CO<inf>2</inf> emission reach 0.273 kg/kWh, which was the lowest value. Moreover, by enhancing the utilization factor from 0.65 to 0.9, the amount of pollution in the system with vanadium chloride cycle was reduced by 24%, which the reduction for the system with PEME was about 20%. Carried out analysis based on the thermodynamic, economic, and environmental index indicated a multi-objective optimization for studied systems.

However, since their NO<inf>x</inf> emissions are higher than that of diesel fuels in most cases and also because of their higher viscosity than diesel, fuel additives are used to enhance their properties and reduce emissions. In this study, the effect of n-hexane and n-hexadecane addition to biodiesel and diesel fuels on exhaust emissions and performance of a single-cylinder diesel engine was investigated by using grey-based Taguchi method. Fuel additive, the additive amount, and fuel type were considered as the operating parameters. Three fuel types including diesel, rapeseed oil biodiesel, and cottonseed oil biodiesel were used in this investigation, while n-hexane and n-hexadecane were considered as the two fuel additives. As well as, three levels were assigned to the additive amount which were 4, 8, and 12%. Based on the operating parameters and their levels, the plan of experiments was generated according to L<inf>18</inf> orthogonal array. Using grey relational analysis, this multi-response optimization problem was first transformed into a single response optimization. Then, this single system response, which is known as grey relational grade, was utilized in Taguchi approach for statistical evaluations. The results demonstrated that rapeseed was the best selection for fuel type compared to cottonseed and diesel in order to have the optimum system responses and hexadecane gave better results for system optimization in comparison with hexane additive. As well as, the analysis of variance showed that fuel type was the predominant operating factor influencing the grey relational grade which means fuel type was the most important parameter in the simultaneous optimization of exhaust emissions and engine performance. The Taguchi results also revealed that the optimum condition of engine performance and exhaust emissions happened when engine was fueled with rapeseed biodiesel containing 12% hexadecane as an additive. The confirmation test result validated the reliability of Taguchi approach in this investigation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biodiesel; Exhaust emission; Fuel additive; Grey relational analysis; Multi-objective optimization; Taguchi method"

In this paper, a two-phase approach to design and optimize a biofuel supply chain based on Jatropha Curcas L. oil and used cooking oil (UCO) is presented by considering the nexus between energy, water, food, waste, and land (EWFWL) in order to protect natural resources and create environmental security. In the first phase, the most appropriate sites for Jatropha cultivation are determined by considering the accessibility, geological, environmental and climatic criteria, using the Geographic Information System (GIS). In the second phase, a novel multi-objective model is designed considering the EWFWL nexus and solved using the Torabi-Hassini method. The model is validated using real data from Fars province, Iran, as well as a sensitivity analysis. In this study, some of main contributions are identifying suitable Jatropha cultivation sites in Fars province, Iran; development an innovative optimization model regarding EWFWL nexus; and considering financial parameters and global distribution along with EWFWL nexus. According to the results, the sale of biofuel to local and foreign consumers accounts for the largest proportion of network revenues, contributing for 59.25% of total revenue. Furthermore, increasing the use of UCOs for biofuel production will reduce Jatropha output, and consequently reduce water, land use, and increase food security. If UCO shortage occurs, more lands will be dedicated to Jatropha farms and food-loss and water consumption increase. By focusing on biofuel production over UCO, policymakers can produce less Jatropha and decrease the use of land for Jatropha cultivation. Furthermore, effluent-based irrigation can be more widely used to save fresh water by irrigating Jatropha farms. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuel supply chain; Biofuels; Energy - water - food - wase - land nexus; Geographic Information System"

Many Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies were conducted to quantify the potential environmental impacts of biodiesel production; however, only a few studies have considered the spatial and temporal heterogeneities of the studied regions. Furthermore, previous studies have usually only focused on the greenhouse gas (GHG) savings of biodiesel and have ignored the environmental burden and economic profits of biodiesel production. For the first time, we combined the Regional Environmental LCA model with an economic analysis to evaluate both the environmental impact and the economic benefits of biodiesel production in Central Germany (CG). Our results showed that emissions from rapeseed cultivation were the largest contributor to both global and regional environmental impact categories. In our study region, we found that GHG emissions were around 56%–71% lower for rapeseed-based biodiesel than for fossil fuels. Due to the drought in 2018, we also observed that the regional rapeseed supply could not meet the demand of biodiesel production in CG. An economic analysis of biodiesel production found significant economies of scale effect in the biodiesel industry. In addition, none of the studied biodiesel plants were able to operate at their designed installed capacities without causing indirect land-use change. Furthermore, the profitability of biodiesel production was closely related to the feedstock cultivation cost. Based on these findings, we concluded that a regionalized LCA model would be able to more accurately evaluate the environmental influence of biodiesel production by taking site-specific conditions into consideration. We also suggest that potential biodiesel plant operators take the regional biodiesel production density and feedstock cultivation conditions into account when deciding on plant size. © 2021 The Authors.

Human activity, mainly in the industrial and transportation sectors, is one of the main causes of the above scenario. Bioethanol and biobutanol have emerged as possible solutions to this problem, however, their production is not economically competitive. Therefore, in addition to biofuel production, the generation of high value-added products in a biorefinery scheme is mandatory to improve the economic potential of the biomass-based industry. Mexico is a country with a high agricultural production, which implies a high production of agricultural waste. Therefore, this work proposes the development of a mathematical model for the supply chain of biofuels and bioproducts production. This model is a multi-objective optimization problem through generalized disjunctive programming. The GDP model is relaxed and solved in its equivalent mixed integer linear programming form using GAMS software. The model analyzes the production of bioethanol and/or biobutanol to satisfy at least 10% of the gasoline demand in the country, as well as the production of high value-added products; considering economic, environmental, economic and social objectives. Pareto-optimal solutions were obtained using the ε constraint method and selecting the best option by the Pythagorean theorem of the Eucladian distance. According to the results, biobutanol production is the process that maintains the greatest compromise between the four objective functions, achieving a balance.

Many design problems involve selection of reactions from many alternatives, and systematic methods for choosing reaction pathways have also been developed. To prevent burden shifting, selection of reaction pathways needs to consider activities at larger scales of the life cycle and economy. In this work we develop such a framework. The resulting P2P-RNFA framework combines Reaction Network Flux Analysis (RNFA) and Process-to-Planet (P2P) frameworks by means of a novel multi-scale multi-objective optimization formulation. This framework is capable of designing chemical reaction pathways, life-cycle value-chains, and economic cash flows in an integrated manner from a superstructure network containing alternative solutions. Application to synthesizing industrial biofuel, 3-methyl-tetrahydrofuran, demonstrates the method and its features.

Solvent addition is a simple yet practical approach in upgrading pyrolysis bio-oil. However, most solvents are often manufactured as specialty chemicals, and thus, this leads to a high production cost of solvents. It is crucial for the designed solvent-oil blend to achieve both fuel functionality and economic targets to be competitive with the conventional diesel fuel. Hence, the objective of this work is to generate feasible solvent candidates by solving this multi-objective optimisation (MOO) problem via a computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) approach. Initially, an optimisation model was developed to identify potential solvents that satisfied the predefined targeted properties. Next, a MOO model was developed via a fuzzy optimisation approach to identify the trade-off between profitability and heating value of the solvent-oil blend. A pricing model was employed to estimate the profitability of the solvent-oil blend. The production of bio-oil in a pyrolysis plant was used to illustrate the applicability of the pricing model. Lastly, phase stability analysis was conducted to ensure the stability and miscibility of the solvent-oil blend. With the developed framework, a promising and cost-effective solvent-oil blend can be generated while displaying optimal biofuel properties. © 2021 by the authors.

To this aim, this paper proposes a multi-objective model for the design of agricultural waste-based biofuel production with integrated formulation of location, inventory and routing decisions. Our model allows the decision makers to determine the number and location of residue gathering centers and biorefineries, the routes by which a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles collects the different agricultural waste, and the adequate material flow to meet the biofuel demand. Instead of assuming a fixed facility setting along the supply chain planning horizon, we construct a comprehensive mathematical model that includes: (1) the opening of a certain facility at any time period; (2) plant capacity expansion within the planning horizon; and (3) the facility closing not necessarily at last time period. The original model formulation is a three-objective stochastic Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming. However, we propose a linearization strategy to efficiently convert our model into a MILP formulation. Since the proposed optimization model belongs to the class of NP-hard problems, a two-phase heuristic method is utilized to solve the formulated model. The constructive phase of our heuristic provides an initial solution that is further enhanced by a Simulated Annealing algorithm. We tested the proposed heuristic method for small, medium and large-scale problem instances. The computational results demonstrate that our heuristic is running-time efficient and highly competitive in terms of solution quality, compared to the exact method outcomes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic capacity setting; Location-inventory-routing; Simulated annealing; Sustainable supply chain"

Traditionally, these parameters are obtained through an enormous amount of trial and error experiments. To reduce these challenges, a new global model-based calibration scheme is proposed in this study for the development of optimum split injection control look-up map. The combinations of engine operating and control variable test conditions are framed through the I-optimal experimental design technique. Based on the experimentally measured responses, the response surface methodology (RSM) and deep neural network (DNN) estimation approaches are employed to set up a model between calibration parameters and the engine behaviour parameters. The multi-objective optimization using the desirability approach is carried in focus to equivalent importance of performance and emissions. The results showed that the DNN model has an excellent predictive performance than the RSM model. Therefore, based on the DNN model, the variation trend of the calibration parameters, the primary performance of the diesel and orange peel oil (20%) blend is examined. In comparison with the un-optimized map for OPO20 fuel, a simultaneous reduction of smoke and brake specific fuel consumption is achieved with a slight penalization in NOx emissions. The higher unsaturated hydrocarbons in OPO20 release higher smoke, it increases the injection pressure and timing advancement in the optimization process. The experimental validation of the optimized OPO20 map at 50% load improves the BTE of 14.06%. It also reduces the smoke to 85.67%, HC of 83.15%, CO of 11.3% and increases the NO<inf>X</inf> to 18.71% relative to the un-optimized map.

For this purpose, multi-objective optimization is applied with support of a life-cycle assessment framework. The validity test of proposed methods adopts as object of study a plausible farm in the Brazilian Midwest, with soybean and maize crop rotation along with cattle fattening in pasture and feedlots, which gives origin to various biofuels chains: biodiesel, bioethanol and biogas. Decisions are based on two life-cycle performance metrics: greenhouse gas emissions and energy balance. Impacts on biofuel life-cycles are apportioned according to the market value of co-products. Strong influence of allocation factors on performance metrics is shown. Soybean biodiesel has greater energy potential than bioethanol and biogas, while generating the lowest greenhouse gas emissions by kg of biofuel. However, high population density of animal fattening in feedlots makes this activity have a greater energy balance by footprint than agriculture, as long as previous phases of animal growth do not occur in the farm. Multi-objective optimization shows that in general the pasture share should be minimized, so the decision relies on sizing the feedlot and agricultural areas. If equal weights are applied to objective-functions, the resulting farm distribution is 88.58% agriculture, 10% pasture, and 1.42% feedlot. The present model can be used to evaluate other systems and further metrics can be applied, allowing land distribution among different agropastoral activities, helping to guide private and public decision-making in the agro-energy sector. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agro-energy; Biofuels; Greenhouse gas emissions; Integrated crop-livestock system; Multi-objective optimization"

Developing renewable resources, hence, is quite unavoidable. Sugarcane, as a source of renewable energy, can be converted to bioethanol. Therefore, this study has proposed a mixed-integer linear programming to design an international network of the sugarcane-to-biofuel supply chain. To deal with uncertainty, the robust optimization approach is employed in order to maximize the profit earned from the bioethanol sales at the foreign/domestic markets, minimize the environmental impacts caused by these supply chain activities, and maximize this network generated employment. The multi-echelon supply chain model involves different production/storage capacities, bio-refineries technologies, and transportation modes. This supply chain configuration has specified the optimal production capacity/technology, the appropriate transportation mode in each route, and the bio-refineries’ development capacities. The biofuel export price and the domestic/foreign markets’ demands are among the SC uncertain parameters addressed through the robust possibilistic programming. Finally, the tri-objective model has been solved using an approach that considers the decision maker’s preferences; the model performance has been verified by a case study performed in Iran. To verify the robust model’s efficiency, the DLP realization model is also formulated.

Moreover, almost all of them have used non-monetary-based environmental indicators, which result in difficulties with clarity when comparing with economic objectives. Therefore, in this work, an effort is made to develop a more reliable planning strategy that offers optimal strategic and tactical decisions simultaneously and maximizes the economic and environmental benefits.

The expansion of advanced liquid biofuels use can contribute to increase the sustainable bioenergy deployment while reducing GHG emissions in comparison to fossil fuels. In this study, the economic and environmental performance of a biorefinery involving biomass gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch (FT) liquid biofuels production associated to sugarcane value chain is explored through a multiobjective optimization approach. The biorefinery configurations investigated include different biomass combinations, and the possibility of integrating the thermochemical processes to a first-generation ethanol distillery or operating it as a stand-alone plant. Different biomass mix considering conventional sugarcane, energy-cane and eucalyptus are considered in the optimization strategy. A Design of Experiments with a second-order polynomial regression technique is used to fit a metamodel from detailed and high-fidelity spreadsheet-based process models. Internal Rate of Return and avoided GHG emissions per agricultural land occupation are used as objective functions. The Pareto-optimal curves show the best performance possibilities and allows to identify the most suitable biorefinery configurations. Results indicate there is an economic benefit from the integration between the thermochemical process and conventional first-generation ethanol mills. An increase in cane and eucalyptus processing capacities tends to improve the economic performance due to the gain of scale. A higher proportion of energy-cane processed leads to better environmental performance as it reduces both the GHG emissions and the demand for agricultural land. In contrast, a greater share of energy-cane present trade-offs on the economic performance in the integrated biorefinery caused by the higher energy demand and lower ethanol production, but a minor effect is observed on the stand-alone configuration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Advanced biofuels; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Metamodel; Multiobjective optimization; Sugarcane biorefinery; Thermochemical conversion"

Normally, these waste materials are allowed to decay in the natural process or burnt to recover a part of the energy in the thermal form, leading to environmental pollution and loss of value. There is an imperative need to realize that food waste is a bundle of energy, which requires carefully planned recovery without damaging the environment. Conversion of food waste to bio-based liquid or gaseous fuels appears to be an attractive option to meet the escalating demand for fuel and at the same time slowing down the fast-depleting fossil fuel resources.

This is attributed to several challenges, in which the economic unattractiveness, especially the requirement of excessively high initial investment costs, is the major one. To address this challenge, a quantitative-based design and planning of the biomass-to-biofuel supply chain (BBSC), which is backed by optimization, is compulsory. Henceforth, this study intends to develop an optimization model that seeks to maximize the profit and minimize the investment cost of the BBSC. The optimization model is applied to the real case of Ethiopia's BBSC to provide a planning support tool for the policy-makers over a 20-year horizon. Although several economic optimization models developed so far, this contribution broadens the preceding research endeavors by considering the following efforts simultaneously. An integrated strategic-tactical level model is developed to prevent non-optimal and infeasible results, which might arise from separate models. Adverse to the integrated strategic-tactical models developed so far, a multi-product BBSC that produces bioethanol and biodiesel with the associated co-products and a comprehensive supply chain, which incorporates a decentralized preprocessing unit, along with the other relevant components, is considered. The investment decisions related to location, technology, and capacity of facilities happen on yearly basis, unlike many studies that consider this decision only at the beginning of the planning period. The model size boosts as it is a real and comprehensive national-level case study. Therefore, a new approach is proposed here to analyze the compromise between the objectives in a justifiable computational time with efficient optimization resolution.

In a previous work, a detailed steady-state model of the system, featuring components validated with industrial data, was developed to simulate the system and analyze its behavior in different conditions. The results obtained from this model were used to create response surfaces capable of evaluating the impact of the main operating parameters (fuel cell area, stack current density, and recuperator (REC) surface) on the performance and the profitability of the plant considering system uncertainties. In this paper, similar but extended response surfaces will be used to perform a multi-objective optimization of the system considering the capital costs of the plant and the net power produced as objectives (turbocharger is fixed in geometry). The impact of the energy market scenario on the optimal design of such a system will be investigated considering its installation in three different countries.

Third‐generation biodiesel derived from algae sources can be a feasible option in tackling climate change caused by fossil fuels as it has no impact on the human food supply chain. In this paper, the combustion and emission characteristics of Azolla Pinnata oil biodiesel‐diesel blends are investigated. The multi‐ob-jective response surface methodology (MORSM) with Box–Behnken design is employed to decrease the number of trials to conserve finite resources in terms of human labor, time, and cost. MORSM was used in this study to investigate the interaction, model prediction, and optimization of the operating parameters of algae biodiesel‐powered diesel engines to obtain the best performance with the least emission. For engine output prediction, a prognostic model is developed. Engine operating parameters are optimized using the desirability technique, with the best efficiency and lowest emission as the criteria. The results show Theil’s uncertainty for the model’s predictive capability (Theil’s U2) to be between 0.0449 and 0.1804. The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency is validated to be excellent between 0.965 and 0.9988, whilst the mean absolute percentage deviation is less than 4.4%.

Green manufacturing is one of the key approaches that begin to address environmental issues. With the current global attention, methodologies to incorporate green manufacturing into the design of green products through the green process route are much needed. However, it is challenging for industries to achieve this, as there is no definite definition of green. This work presents a systematic approach that provides a clear and consistent green manufacturing definition with a measurement method in terms of both product and process. With the consistent green definitions, the developed approach designs a product that satisfies green property and other product performance properties. In addition, the developed approach synthesises the production process that fulfils green manufacturing definitions and financial considerations for the designed product. A case study on the design and production of green biofuel is solved to illustrate the efficacy of the approach. Green product design is obtained by identifying molecular building blocks that fulfil the targeted properties using an inverse molecular design technique. The goal is to design a chemical product that is environmentally friendly while fulfilling customer requirements. Moreover, a superstructural mathematical optimisation approach is used to determine optimal conversion pathways that have minimal environmental impact on the production of the identified green product. The utilisation of multi-objective optimisation allows the design of product and process to strike a good balance between operational and environmental performances. © 2021 by the authors.

These marine biofuel demand scenarios were based on the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction targets of the Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO). A multi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model was developed which is used to optimize the Well-to-Tank (WtT) phases of each studied scenario. This resulted in an overview of the most feasible use of feedstocks, deployment of new conversion technologies and trade flows between regions. Additionally, the results provided insight into the costs and emission reduction potential of marine biofuels. By analyzing the results from this study, improved insight into the potential of drop-in biofuels for reaching the proposed emission reduction targets for the maritime sector was developed. A trade-off between costs and emissions was found to result in potential GHG reductions between 68–95% compared to Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) for 800–2300 EUR/ton.

The model was applied to a case study of Maharashtra, India, considering 33 districts and five different feedstock to produce ethanol to meet the 10% gasoline blending target. The optimal values for ethanol cost, GHG emission, and water footprint were Rs. 50.39/l ($ 0.69/l), 0.933 kg CO<inf>2</inf> eq./l and 0.271 m3/l, respectively, while a total of 5087 jobs were created in the biorefineries for job maximization.

Scientific research in this field typically confines the environmental dimension to global warming, disregarding other environmental impact and damage categories. By multi-criteria mixed-integer linear programming, this work examines environmental benefits and economic viability of optimal second-generation bioethanol production network configurations to substitute petrol and/or first-generation bioethanol in the EU. The results comprise environmentally optimal decisions for 18 impact and 3 damage categories, as well as economically optimal solutions for different excise and carbon tax scenarios. The impact categories global warming potential, particulate matter, and land use are affected the most. Optimal network decisions for different environmental objectives can be clustered into three groups of mutual congruencies, but opportunity costs between the different groups can be very high, indicating conflicting decisions. The decision to substitute petrol or first-generation ethanol has the greatest influence. The results of the multi-dimensional analysis suggest that the damage categories human health and ecosystem quality are suitable to unveil tradeoffs between conflicting environmental impacts, for example, global warming and land use. Taking human health and ecosystem quality as environmental decision criteria, second-generation bioethanol should be used to concurrently substitute first-generation bioethanol and petrol (100% and 18% of today's demand in the EU, respectively). However, economic optimization shows that with current taxation, bioethanol is hardly competitive with petrol, and that excise tax abatement or carbon taxes are needed to achieve these volumes.

From an engineering perspective, the commercial establishment of lignocellulosic bioethanol plants is still hindered by increased production cost. High product concentrations with improved yield and productivity at the fermentation stage seem to be inviolable condition to straightly compete with fossil-based and first-generation bioethanol facilities. This study proposes a model-based multi-objective dynamic optimization approach to systematically derive optimal operating policies for the fermentation bioreactor as a step forward towards enhancing the economic performance of lignocellulosic bioethanol plants. The economic benefit of the derived optimal bioreactor strategies is evaluated via a scalable economic index, linking for the first time the performance of the fermentation bioreactor to the economics of the entire production process. It is demonstrated that high values in productivity and substantial compromises in yield and final bioethanol concentration are conditions which favor economic feasibility with the achieved fermentation performance (3.32 g L−1 h−1, 0.399 g g−1, 106.0 g L−1) being comparable to first-generation bioethanol production. Finally, a global system analysis framework is employed to investigate the robustness of the optimal value of the economic index to the variability of key model parameters, illustrating the impact of model uncertainty on the process economic performance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bioethanol production cost; Multi-objective dynamic optimization; Process performance vs. economic indices; Quantification of model uncertainty; Second-generation bioethanol"

Lignocellulosic biofuels are equivalents to petroleum products and can be adapted to meet the properties requirements of current engines. However, their major disadvantages are the high production costs and the lack of infrastructure. In this work, the focus is on the implementation of a multi-objective optimization methodology for synthesis of novel intensified biomass-to-liquid (BtL) technologies with lower environmental impact and costs, as well as higher process safety and efficiency. A novel optimization methodology is applied to two process configurations that were synthesized in a previous work [1], in which the evaluation of a BtL processing superstructure under different economic constraints and product profiles scenarios was performed. From the configurations, the two case studies with higher production of both gasoline and diesel were selected for this work. For the synthesis of intensified BtL technologies, the optimal separation units’ design parameters that meet the combination of economic, safety and environmental indexes, and two green chemistry metrics were selected.

This study deals with combustion, vibration, and noise measurement for diesel engine powered with biofuel blend in the perspective of passenger comfort at engine idle condition. Experimentation is performed using a 20% blend of lemon peel oil with diesel (B20) according to central composite design (CCD) by varying pilot mass (PM), pilot injection timing (PIT), injection pressure, and engine speed (ES). Vibrations at engine crankcase, cylinder head were measured with a triaxial accelerometer along with noise measurement. The output responses for diesel and B20 were compared based on the output from response surface methodology (RSM). The study observed that predominant vibrations at the crankcase level along the lateral direction of the engine influenced by fuel injection pressure (FIP) and engine speed for both test fuels. Engine head vibrations were maximum along with the reciprocating motion of piston for both test fuels and found 7.43% more in case diesel. Engine noise is comparable from both test conditions irrespective of different influencing parameters. An increment of 1.662 J/deg in the heat release rate (HRR) of B20 is observed attributed to a longer ignition delay of B20 fuel.

However, previous modeling studies have not looked into the opportunity of integrating productivity reduction related to the continuous recirculation and reuse of resources until it reaches its end of life.

Firstly, this introduces a bi-objective closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network by deliberating on farming of herbs and production plus distribution of associated herbal medicines in manufacturing-chain layer. Reverse-chain layer (RC-layer) recycles used substrates and unused herbs, thus producing biofuels and casing soil. Though majority of well-established CLSC models comprise sole pecuniary objective function, this aims to validates the economic self-reliance of RC-layer. Besides, Governments pay the subsidy to various entities, including the growers to encourage countrywide farming of herbs and the biofuels-plants for the extent of clean fuel produced. Thus, two different partners of same network earn subsidy without analysing trade-off. Secondly, this study develops an emended minmax method based interactive bi-objective optimization algorithm by employing absolute difference function and newly introduced semi-autonomized desired levels in real-life oriented T-environment. In pessimistic business scenario, whereas proposed model turns infeasible in classical interactive fuzzy multi-objective optimization algorithm, proposed algorithm determines corresponding Pareto optimal solution. In optimistic business scenario, optimal net profits to both layers of proposed model are more desirable than respective goals in proposed algorithm. Vulnerability analysis of twelve parameters to proposed model plus twelve subfigures pleads legislators to offer more subsidy to biofuels-plants and slightly lesser to growers; and to enact regulations to intensify the recycling of discarded substrates and herbs, thereby ensuring financial feasibility of RC-layer. Again, reduced subsidy to biofuels-plants and little more subsidy to growers, plus multi-angled modernization of all partners except landfills elevate the profitability of proposed network. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biofuels; Closed-loop supply chain; Interactive fuzzy minmax multi-objective optimization; Marketing; Production"

Various bioenergy feedstocks are suggested as environmentally friendly solutions due to their positive impact on stream health and ability to sequester carbon, but most evaluations for bioenergy feedstocks have not evaluated the implications of bioenergy crop production holistically to date. Through the application of multi-objective optimization on 10 bioenergy feedstock rotations in a Michigan watershed, a Pareto front is searched to identify optimal trade-off solutions for three objective functions representing stream health, environmental emissions/carbon footprint, and economic feasibility. Various multi-criteria decision-making techniques are then applied to the resulting Pareto front to select a set of most-preferred trade-off solutions, which are compared to optimal solutions from each individual objective function. The most-preferred trade-off solutions indicate that a diverse mix of rotations are necessary to optimize all three objectives, whereas the individually optimal solutions do not consider a diverse range of feedstocks, thereby making the proposed multi-objective treatment an important and pragmatic strategy. © 2021 by the authors.

To obtain the optimal biomass raw material and bio-oil production technology, Eco-indicator 99 was used to quantify the environmental impacts of the co-processing process, and a multi-objective optimization model was proposed to simultaneously reduce the economic costs and the environmental impacts. The results showed that catalytic pyrolysis was superior to fast pyrolysis in both reducing economic costs and environmental impacts; the different optimal biomasses were obtained under different objectives; biomass cost accounted for the largest proportion of costs and environmental impacts. Therefore, when optimizing the co-processing process, the environmental impact of the process should be considered. Reducing the biomass consumption is the most effective way to reduce both the costs and environmental impacts of the co-processing process. © All Right Reserved.","Biomass; Co-process; FCC; Multi-objective optimization; Optimal design; Pyrolysis; Vacuum gas oil"

In the long term, this unyielding dependency is threatened by the depletion of the crude oil reserve. However, in the short term, its price highly fluctuates due to various factors, such as regional and global security instability causing additional complexity on refinery production planning. The petroleum refining industries are also drawing criticism and pressure due to their direct and indirect impacts on the environment. The exhaust gas emission of automobiles apart from the industrial and power plant emission has been viewed as the cause of global warming. In this sense, there is a need for a feasible, sustainable, and environmentally friendly generation process of fuels and chemicals. The attention turns to the utilization of biomass as a potential feedstock to produce substitutes for petroleum-derived fuels and building blocks for biochemicals. Biomass is abundant and currently is still low in utilization. The biorefinery, a facility to convert biomass into biofuels and biochemicals, is still lacking in competitiveness to a petroleum refinery. An attractive solution that addresses both is by the integration of bio- and petroleum refineries. In this context, the right decision making in the process selection and technologies can lower the investment and operational costs and assure optimum yield. Process optimization based on mathematical programming has been extensively used to conduct techno-economic and sustainability analysis for bio-, petroleum, and the integration of both refineries. This paper provides insights into the context of crude oil and biomass as potential refinery feedstocks. The current optimization status of either bio- or petroleum refineries and their integration is reviewed with the focus on the methods to solve the multi-objective optimization problems. Internal and external uncertain parameters are important aspects in process optimization. The nature of these uncertain parameters and their representation methods in process optimization are also discussed. © 2020 by the authors.","Biomass; Biorefinery; Mathematical programming deterministic; Multi-objective optimization; Process optimization; Single-objective optimization; Stochastics"

However, quantitative schemes for understanding and predicting productivities, yields, mass transfer rates, gas flow profiles and detailed energy requirements have been lacking in literature; such are invaluable tools for process improvements and better systems design. The present study describes the construction of a hybrid model for simulating ethanol production inside a 700 m3 bubble column bioreactor fed with gas of two possible compositions, i.e., pure CO and a 3:1 mixture of H<inf>2</inf> and CO<inf>2</inf>. Results: Estimations made using the thermodynamics-based black-box model of microbial reactions on substrate threshold concentrations, biomass yields, as well as CO and H<inf>2</inf> maximum specific uptake rates agreed reasonably well with data and observations reported in literature. According to the bioreactor simulation, there is a strong dependency of process performance on mass transfer rates. When mass transfer coefficients were estimated using a model developed from oxygen transfer to water, ethanol productivity reached 5.1 g L-1 h-1; when the H<inf>2</inf>/CO<inf>2</inf> mixture is fed to the bioreactor, productivity of CO fermentation was 19% lower. Gas utilization reached 23 and 17% for H<inf>2</inf>/CO<inf>2</inf> and CO fermentations, respectively. If mass transfer coefficients were 100% higher than those estimated, ethanol productivity and gas utilization may reach 9.4 g L-1 h-1 and 38% when feeding the H<inf>2</inf>/CO<inf>2</inf> mixture at the same process conditions. The largest energetic requirements for a complete manufacturing plant were identified for gas compression and ethanol distillation, being higher for CO fermentation due to the production of CO<inf>2</inf>. Conclusions: The thermodynamics-based black-box model of microbial reactions may be used to quantitatively assess and consolidate the diversity of reported data on CO, CO<inf>2</inf> and H<inf>2</inf> threshold concentrations, biomass yields, maximum substrate uptake rates, and half-saturation constants for CO and H<inf>2</inf> for syngas fermentations by acetogenic bacteria. The maximization of ethanol productivity in the bioreactor may come with a cost: low gas utilization.

Recently, furans have gathered much attention in the research community as they are second-generation biofuels that do not compete with food supplies, unlike first-generation biofuels. Moreover, they are oxygenated and highly resistant to knocking when compressed. A four-component chemical reaction mechanism, consisting of furan, 2-methylfuran, 2,5-dimethylfuran, and toluene, is developed to simulate the combustion of unsaturated furans under engine-relevant conditions. First, a detailed furan, 2-methylfuran, and 2,5-dimethylfuran reaction mechanism from the literature is selected and reduced under engine-relevant conditions. Sensitivity analysis and the species rate of production are employed to identify the major reaction pathways of the respective furanic components under different conditions. After which, isomer lumping and reaction lumping are used to further reduce the size of the major reaction pathways and the skeletal major reaction pathways for furan, 2-methylfuran, and 2,5-dimethylfuran are included to a compact toluene base mechanism from the literature to form the final mechanism, consisting of only 62 species among 228 reactions. Subsequently, the pre-exponential A factors in Arrhenius equations of the furanic reactions are optimized via an in-house multiobjective nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, and successively, the generalized polynomial chaos is introduced to model the uncertainty of the input rate coefficient and its propagation in ignition behavior. The performance of the different furanic components in the mechanism is then validated against experimental data from the literature. The predicted results are in reasonable agreement with experimental results considering the compact size of the developed mechanism and the challenge of multiobjective optimization. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",""

Especially biodiesel and ethanol have been considered as major alternative fuels as they are derived from renewable sources. These fuels are well oxygenated and therefore have a great potential to reduce emissions. Biodiesel, which is chemically derived from edible oils or animal fats by transesterification reaction, is esters of long-chain saturated/unsaturated fatty acids and can be an important alternative fuel source to consider for the vehicle. It can offer desirable features to diesel engines, and internal combustion engines (ICEs) in particular.

Second-order models obtained using response surface methodology (RSM) to predict the effect of input variables on response surfaces were statistically significant at an alpha level of 1.

We develop a mixed-integer linear programming model to incorporate spatial, agricultural, techno-economical, and environmental data for multi-objective optimization of RJF supply chain systems. The model is applied to the Midwestern U.S. to evaluate the sustainability performance of three pathways including alcohol-to-jet (ATJ), Fischer-Tropsch (FT) and Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The results show that HTL is the most cost-effective with a cost of $4.64/gal while FT is most environmental-friendly with the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 0.10 kg CO<inf>2</inf>/gal. The cost-optimal analysis suggests a centralized supply chain configuration with large facilities, while the environmental optimization analysis prefers a distributed system with small biorefinery facilities. For FT approach, cost optimization analysis suggests developing a supply chain with one large biorefinery, whereas environmental optimization prefers a system with 11 small biorefineries. Considering the economic and environmental factors simultaneously, the Pareto curve demonstrates that total production costs of three pathways all increase with the more stringent constraints of GHG emissions. This indicates that RJF production costs are sensitive to the regulation of GHG emissions. Considering the carbon price at $0.22 per kg of CO<inf>2</inf> reduction, FT yields the lowest cost of $2.83/gal among three pathways, but it is still 47% higher than that of fossil jet fuel. FT is not cost competitive with fossil jet fuel until the carbon price increases to $0.30 per kg of CO<inf>2</inf> reduction. FT is suggested a promising sustainable RJF production pathway due to its relatively low capital investment and production costs, centralized supply chain configuration, and low GHG emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cost; Greenhouse gas emission; Mixed-integer linear programming; Multi-objective optimization; Pareto-optimal curve; Renewable jet fuel; Supply chain optimization"

Biofuel is considered as an alternative solution for non-renewable sources for energy production. The assurance of this supply relies on a sustainable and efficient supply chain. For this study, a multi-objective model is proposed to structure a sustainable supply chain for second-generation biofuel under a triple bottom line approach. The proposed model captures a trade-off among conflicting objectives. The multiple agricultural regions, multiple biorefineries, transportation, and multiple markets are considered. The yield of residual biomass, the expense at agricultural regions, and the demand of markets are assumed uncertain and denoted by fuzzy numbers. The carbon tax and cap are incorporated into the supply chain model. The improved augmented ε-constraint approach is employed to solve the proposed multi-objective optimization model. The objective of developed research is to design a sustainable supply chain framework which minimizes the total carbon emissions and total cost and maximizes the amount of new jobs opportunities in a second-generation biofuel. A numerical experiment is conducted, and the finding shows that the production cost of biofuel in the biorefineries contains a major proportion of the total cost. The transportation section is the predominant source for carbon emissions and a maximum number of jobs is accrued in rural areas.

However, promoting bioenergy crops would require major change in land use and management practices that can have long term socio-economic and environmental impacts.

We developed a multi-objective optimization model to analyze trade-offs among various components of bioenergy crop production to help make better production decisions. Our model integrated sustainability dimensions including social, economic and environmental factors for bioenergy crop production. As bioenergy crop production may incorporate various objectives, we ran the model by optimizing one objective at a time to measure the magnitude of change in one objective with respect to change in other objectives given a set of constraints. In addition, our model had the ability to assess how trade-offs would be affected by chancing preferences for different factors in the production decisions.

Efficient utilization of the available feedstocks without increasing the pressure on the agricultural land, water and other inputs is essential for overall sustainability. This work focuses on recommending the optimal selection of lignocellulosic feedstock for the Indian biofuel sector considering several sustainability indicators. Six different feedstocks, namely, cotton stalk, rice husk, wheat stalk, sorghum stalk, sugarcane bagasse, and sugarcane molasses, are considered for the production of ethanol using a standardized process. The criteria for selection include life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy return on investment (EROI), life cycle water use, and land use for ethanol production. Since the decision making criteria show trade-offs, multi-objective linear programming problem was formulated. The model targeted a specific amount of ethanol production without exceeding the feedstock availability, and was solved for different ethanol blending targets. The results recommended complete utilization of sugarcane molasses followed by use of feedstocks such as sugarcane bagasse and sorghum stalk. A strong trade-off was observed between GHG footprint and the other two objectives for EROI 5.08 for base case of 20% blending. Optimal feedstock combination included sugarcane molasses (26.8%), sugarcane bagasse (67%), and sorghum stalk (6.2%) for lowest EROI of 5.08. But for highest EROI of 5.6 the optimal feedstock combination included sugarcane molasses (10.2%), sugarcane bagasse (68.3%), sorghum stalk (6.2%) and cotton stalk (15.3%). The scenarios such as reduced availability of sugarcane bagasse, increase in gasoline demand, effect of data variation gives the additional insights for optimal selection of feedstocks for different blending percentages. The work concluded that sugarcane based feedstock were very critical.

Efficient utilization of modified nanofluid fuels (MNF) is possible only when engine operating, fuel injection parameters are optimized accordingly. In the present research, experimental and statistical analysis is carried out on a commercial diesel engine (3.5 KW) with the aim to determine the optimal doping rate of nanoparticles and engine operating parameters using response surface methodology (RSM) and desirability function approach (DFA). The modified nanofluid (MNF) fuels used are blend of Acacia Concinna biodiesel (40% by vol.) and diesel (60% by vol.) mixed with titanium dioxide (TiO2) metal nanoparticles in different concentrations. Initially, the prepared fuel blends are characterized by SEM, TEM, blend stability (Uv–Vis spectrophotometery and sedimentation analysis) and various other properties. The optimal value, TiO<inf>2</inf> doping rate of 150 mg/liter (MNF150), injection timing of 22.5 °CA btdc and 82.37% engine load is found to be the most suitable combination.

The direct application of bio-oils as a fuel is often constrained by their inferior properties such as high water content, high viscosity, low heating values, low miscibility, and storage instability as compared to conventional fuels. One promising method to upgrade bio-oil is the use of solvents as additives to generate a solvent–oil blend capable of meeting both its fuel functionality and sustainability targets in health, safety, and environmental aspects from production to point of application. Suitable solvents were formulated using computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) techniques by solving a two-stage multi-objective optimisation problem based on the defined targets. In the first stage, an optimisation model for solvent–oil blend functionality was constructed to optimise solvent functionality. In the second stage, a fuzzy optimisation approach aimed to optimise environmental, health, and safety (EHS) aspects via an index-based method. By implementing a max–min aggregation approach, an optimised solution has been generated by determining trade-off points that allowed significant EHS improvements at minimal expense of blend functionality. Lastly, the optimal solvent–oil blend was evaluated against conventional diesel in terms of carbon savings. This allowed the quantification of environmental savings through utilising biofuels while ensuring minimal compromise on fuel performance. Altogether, this approach has enabled the identification of feasible solvents for bio-oil upgrade and design of blends for application while allowing multi-objective optimisation of EHS targets. © 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers",""

However, for the specific case of the biodiesel supply chain, little attention has been given to the inclusion of social aspects in an integrated analysis of sustainability performance. This paper in turn proposes and develops a deterministic multi-objective linear programming model to analyze the relationship among the economic, environmental, and food security dimensions of the biodiesel supply chain (BSC) in Colombia. Considering four echelons from the supply chain (palm cultivation, oil extraction, biorefineries, and mixers), the model seeks to minimize total cost, impact on food security, and emissions of greenhouse gases, including emissions from direct and indirect land use change. The Epsilon-constraint method is used to solve the multi-objective model for the BSC. A Pareto set of optimal solutions helped to assess the trade-offs involving the three objectives. The relationship between costs and emissions is contingent upon impact on food security; this is, the design of the supply chain network involving substitution of palm for agricultural crops exhibits lower total cost and lower CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. The proposed generic mathematical model is applicable to any supply chain of agro-fuels and allows the calculation of production, inventory and distribution plans to better satisfy sustainability criteria. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biofuel supply chain; Food security; Multiobjective optimization; Policy analysis; Sustainable development"

Examination of these biological trade-offs can provide invaluable information regarding the biophysical and biochemical bases behind observed cellular phenotypes. A quantitative knowledge of a cell system's critical objectives is also needed for engineering of cellular metabolism, where there is interest in mitigating the fitness costs that may result from human manipulation. Results: To study metabolism in photoheterotrophs, we developed and validated a genome-scale model of metabolism in Rhodopseudomonas palustris, a metabolically versatile gram-negative purple non-sulfur bacterium capable of growing phototrophically on various carbon sources, including inorganic carbon and aromatic compounds. To quantitatively assess trade-offs among a set of important biological objectives during different metabolic growth modes, we used our new model to conduct an 8-dimensional multi-objective flux analysis of metabolism in R. palustris. Our results revealed that phototrophic metabolism in R. palustris is light-limited under anaerobic conditions, regardless of the available carbon source. Under photoheterotrophic conditions, R. palustris prioritizes the optimization of carbon efficiency, followed by ATP production and biomass production rate, in a Pareto-optimal manner. To achieve maximum carbon fixation, cells appear to divert limited energy resources away from growth and toward CO <inf>2</inf> fixation, even in the presence of excess reduced carbon. We also found that to achieve the theoretical maximum rate of biomass production, anaerobic metabolism requires import of additional compounds (such as protons) to serve as electron acceptors. Finally, we found that production of hydrogen gas, of potential interest as a candidate biofuel, lowers the cellular growth rates under all circumstances. Conclusions: Photoheterotrophic metabolism of R. palustris is primarily regulated by the amount of light it can absorb and not the availability of carbon. However, despite carbon's secondary role as a regulating factor, R. palustris' metabolism strives for maximum carbon efficiency, even when this increased efficiency leads to slightly lower growth rates. © 2019 The Author(s).","Autotrophy; Carbon efficiency; Carbon storage; Flux balance analysis; Genome-scale model; Light limitation; Metabolic trade-offs; Multi-objective analysis; Phototrophic metabolism; Rhodopseudomonas palustris"

Its recovery and dehydration to ∼99.5 wt% ethanol is energy-intensive because of dilute feed (∼10 wt% ethanol) and occurrence of ethanol–water azeotrope. From an energy efficiency perspective, hybrid separation processes consisting of a membrane-based module coupled with distillation are a promising alternative to conventional separation by distillation alone. RESULTS: The present article proposes the novel process of double-effect distillation with vapor recompression (DED) for bioethanol recovery followed by vapor permeation (VP) for bioethanol dehydration (to 99.8 wt% ethanol) from a ternary feed of ethanol (10 wt%), water (89.9 wt%) and CO <inf>2</inf> (0.1 wt%) and compares it with the process of simple distillation followed by vapor permeation (D-VP). Multi-objective optimization is performed for both processes, and the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions for minimizing fixed capital investment and annual operating cost are presented and discussed. Compared with the optimal D-VP process, the optimal DED-VP process is found to be better, with 17 and 11% savings in energy consumption and total annual cost (TAC) respectively. CONCLUSION: Specific energy consumption (SEC) of the DED-VP process is 5% lower than that of the hybrid process of distillation for recovery followed by pressure swing adsorption for dehydration (D-PSA) used industrially. Continued developments in membranes that can provide high permeance, selectivity and/or operating life can further reduce TAC and SEC of the DED-VP process. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry","bioethanol separation; double-effect distillation; energy efficiency; multi-objective optimization; total annual cost; vapor permeation"

However, there exist several barriers, such as “food vs fuel” issues and technological constraints, restricting the sustainable commercialization of both first- and second-generation biofuels. Combining arable crops and their residues for hybrid first- and second-generation biofuel production provides opportunities to overcome these barriers. This study presents a high-resolution quantitative tool to support decision-making in feedstock production and sourcing for hybrid biofuel supply chains. We demonstrate this work with a case study on optimizing feedstock landscape design for a hybrid corn grain- and stover-based ethanol production system at Front Range Energy biorefinery, Windsor, Colorado, USA using a coupled simulation modeling and life-cycle assessment approach. The case study considered three competing design objectives including the minimization of feedstock-delivered costs, farm-to-refinery greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and nitrogen (N) leaching, subject to constraints in land use and biofuel feedstock demand.

To do this, experimental data from a previous work obtained in a single-cylinder engine running under ethanol-diesel dual-fuel combustion is used. Then, vehicle systems simulations are used to estimate performance and emissions of the LTC hybrid vehicle and compare them versus conventional diesel combustion (CDC). The vehicle selected to perform the simulations is the Opel Vectra, which equips the compression ignition engine used in the experimental tests. The results from the simulations used for the analysis are firstly optimized by combining design of experiments and the Kriging fitting method. The multi-objective optimization allows to determine some characteristics and controls of the hybrid vehicle. The comparison of the estimated performance and emissions of the LTC-hybrid concept versus CDC over the worldwide harmonized light vehicles test cycle (WLTC)and real driving cycle (RDE)revealed clear benefits in terms of energy consumption, CO<inf>2</inf> and NOx and soot emissions. In this sense, the hybrid concept enabled a reduction of the final energy consumed of 3% in the RDE cycle and 6.5% in the WLTC as compared to CDC. In terms of engine-out emissions, the CO<inf>2</inf> was reduced around 16% versus CDC, and engine-out NOx and soot were reduced below the levels imposed by the Euro 6 regulation. As a penalty, the engine-out HC and CO emissions increased to more than double than CDC. However, based on previous experimental results, it is expected that a conventional diesel oxidation catalyst can reduce the tail-pipe HC and CO levels below the Euro 6 limits. © 2019","Alternative fuels; Driving cycles; Dual-fuel combustion; Low temperature combustion; Series hybrid vehicle"

Therefore, we propose an innovative data-driven surrogate modeling framework, which considerably reduces computing time from months to days by exploiting state-of-the-art deep learning technology.

Researchers are constantly searching for new sources of energy due to increased energy demand. Engine tests are being conducted to investigate the feasibility of the new sources of energy such as alternative fuels. In the engine tests, engine performance, combustion characteristics and exhaust emissions are evaluated by obtaining the results. The effect of newly developed fuels on engine lifetime, safe transport and storage are also examined for fuel availability. In addition, the potential and the price of fuels are important in terms of sustainability. In these studies, laboratory environments are needed for experimental setups. It is difficult to determine the availability of the most suitable alternative fuel since numerous results are obtained in the engine tests and studies. This integrated model provides a great advantage in terms of time and cost. The physical and chemical properties of the fuel affect experimental results such as engine performance, combustion, and exhaust emission. The suggested model can be making the most efficient and eco-friendly fuel choice without the need for experimental studies by using physical and chemical properties of the fuel. It also can offer the best fuel for cost, safety and maintenance processes. In this study, animal fat biodiesel derived from waste animal fats and vegetable oil biodiesel produced from aspir-canola oils were investigated. Biodiesel fuels are mixed with diesel at 5%, 20%, and 50%, and nine different fuels prepared with three pure fuels, and six different fuel blends are compared. Before using these fuels in an experimental study, estimates are made about which fuels may be more advantageous in terms of many criteria. In the process, nine varied fuel specifications are taken as references such as calorific value, cetane number, oxygen content rate, fuel price, flash point, viscosity, lubricity, iodine number and water content. The criteria weights are determined with SWARA (Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis) from multi-criteria decision-making models, and MULTIMOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis) is ranked according to fuels' characteristics from the best to the worst. While theoretically, the best fuel is ultimately VOB20, VOB50 and AFB20 were selected as the second fuel and the third fuel. © 2018 by the authors.","Animal fat biodiesel; ANP; Fuel characteristics; MOORA; Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM); MULTIMOORA; SWARA; Vegetable oil biodiesel"

Results show that the replacement proposed decreases approximately 15% of the amount of vinasse. Moreover, as the modifications do not change the outlet flowrates, such revamping might be done without additional operational changes that could affect the productivity. The environmental evaluation presents positive results, showing that the new configuration may decrease all environmental impacts categories assessed. From an economic perspective, the plant could also have higher profits, presenting a payback period of 3.57 years.

We integrate computable general equilibrium (CGE)-based LUC modeling and LCO to create a novel multiobjective CGE-LUC-LCO framework to account for global environmental impacts and production costs. The framework is then applied to case studies on life cycle GHG emissions throughout the bioethanol life cycle, considering regional and global agricultural practices, land use, technological impacts, and global economic forces. The framework considers emissions from feedstock production, transportation, direct/indirect processing emissions, end use, and LUC. The model allows for selection of 16 bioethanol production pathways from 5 feedstocks, and 3 case studies with US and EU bioethanol demands are examined.

This paper proposes a multiobjective optimization model for a 4-layer biofuel supply chain network using mixed integer nonlinear programming while considering the benefits from economic, environmental, and societal aspects. The model can be used either to optimize an existing biofuel supply chain network or to guide the construction of a new biofuel supply chain network. The profit, the greenhouse gas emissions in transportation, and the market share of biofuel were set as targets for optimization. The selection of the participators at each layer, and the amount of the material flow between each pair of selected supplier and customer located at two adjacent layers were modeled as decision variables. The conventional weighted aggregation method was used to unify 3 objectives after normalization. Particle swarm optimization was used to solve this high-dimension multiobjective problem to obtain a near optimal solution. A numerical case study based on the state of Missouri in the United States was implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results of the case study illustrate that the benefits in terms of transportation emission, profit, and market share can be achieved simultaneously. Using the equal weights configuration in conventional weighted aggregation as an example, a 21% reduction of the transportation emission, a 33% increase of the profit, and a 2% augmentation of the market share were achieved compared to the benchmark scenario. © © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","biofuel supply chain; greenhouse gas emission; multiobjective optimization; particle swarm optimization; sustainability"

In order to avoid the ‘food versus fuel competition’, arising from grain-based ethanol production, the United States has passed regulations that require second generation or cellulosic biofeedstocks to be used for majority of the biofuel production by 2022. Agricultural residue, such as corn stover, is currently the largest source of cellulosic feedstock. However, increased harvesting of crops residue may lead to increased application of fertilizers in order to recover the soil nutrients lost from the residue removal. Alternatively, introduction of less-fertilizer intensive perennial grasses such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus Greef et Deu.) can be a viable source for biofuel production. Even though these grasses are shown to reduce nutrient loads to a great extent, high production cost have constrained their wide adoptability to be used as a viable feedstock. Nonetheless, there is an opportunity to optimize feedstock production to meet bioenergy demand while improving water quality. This study presents a multi-objective simulation optimization framework using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Multi Algorithm Genetically Adaptive Method (AMALGAM) to develop optimal cropping pattern with minimum nutrient delivery and minimum biomass production cost. Computational time required for optimization was significantly reduced by loose coupling SWAT with an external in-stream solute transport model. Optimization was constrained by food security and biofuel production targets that ensured not more than 10% reduction in grain yield and at least 100 million gallons of ethanol production. A case study was carried out in St. Joseph River Watershed that covers 280,000 ha area in the Midwest U.S. Results of the study indicated that introduction of corn stover removal and perennial grass production reduce nitrate and total phosphorus loads without compromising on food and biofuel production. Optimization runs yielded an optimal cropping pattern with 32% of watershed area in stover removal, 15% in switchgrass and 2% in Miscanthus. The optimal scenario resulted in 14% reduction in nitrate and 22% reduction in total phosphorus from the baseline. This framework can be used as an effective tool to take decisions regarding environmentally and economically sustainable strategies to minimize the nutrient delivery at minimal biomass production cost, while simultaneously meeting food and biofuel production targets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Non-point source pollution; Spatial optimization; SWAT"

Developing an environmentally benign, economically feasible, and socially acceptable fuel portfolio can generally, improve the sustainability of future transportation systems. This study aims to predict an optimal fuel portfolio based on different concerns for light-duty vehicles of Iran in the light of alternative fuels until 2025. Six potential fossil and renewable fuels including gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquid petroleum gas (LPG), a mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline (E85) and biodiesel, and one gasoline-electric hybrid technology competed through an integrated fuzzy multi-objective programming. Seven goals with environmental, cost, social and policy nature, as well as systematic constraints and fuel priority (obtained by the application of a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method) had to be met in the model. The solution of the model along with the sensitivity analysis of weights and aspiration levels indicated that with an acceptable possibility of achieving the goals, CNG had the greatest share in the optimal fuel portfolio followed by gasoline, LPG and diesel. Through the intended horizon, the fossil fuels’ share has declined such that 13.5% of the optimal portfolio was replaced by hybrid technology, biodiesel and E85 in 2025, and more importantly, carbon dioxide emission and fuel cost could be mitigated by 11% and 18%, respectively in the same year. Two scenarios focusing on environmental and cost goals were defined through assigning 70% and 80% of the weights to the related goals, respectively; the results revealed that the main characteristics of the optimal portfolio were stable. Likewise, the analysis of the aspiration and tolerance levels of the goals proved the stability of the model and revealed that these parameters play a sensitive role in the model and could affect the optimality and feasibility of the solutions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuel; Fuel portfolio optimization; Light-duty vehicle; Multi-objective programming; Transportation alternative fuel"

This study uses high-resolution spatial data for west Tennessee to quantify the effects of producing switchgrass for cellulosic ethanol on the grey water footprint (GWF), or the amount of freshwater needed to dilute nitrate leachate to a safe level, relative to existing agricultural production. In addition, the estimated cost and GWF are incorporated in a mixed-integer multi-objective optimization model to derive the efficient frontier of the feedstock supply chain and determine a switchgrass supply chain that achieves the greatest reduction in GWF at the lowest cost. Results suggest that background nitrate concentration in ambient water and the types of agricultural land converted to switchgrass production influence the extent of the GWF. The average GWF of switchgrass in the study area ranges between 131.8 L L−1 and 145.9 L L−1 of ethanol, which falls into the range of estimated GWF of other lignocellulosic biomass feedstock in the literature. Also, the average cost of reducing GWF from the feedstock supply chain identified by the compromise solution method is $0.94 m−3 in the region. A tradeoff between biofuel production costs and reduced nitrate loading in groundwater is driven by differences in the agricultural land converted to feedstock production. Our findings illustrate the energy-water-food nexus in the development of a local bioenergy sector and provide a management strategy associated with land use choices for the supply of energy crops. However, the water quality improvements associated with displacing crop with feedstock production in one region could be offset by expanded or more intensive agricultural production in other regions. © 2017","Agricultural land use; Biofuel; Grey water footprint; Multi-objective; Switchgrass"

Such bioenergy systems can potentially reduce environmental footprints by reusing waste streams from other processes within the system. An integrated biorefinery utilizes multiple conversion technologies to produce an array of products, such as biofuels, biochemicals, and bioenergy, from biomass feedstocks. Methodologies such as mathematical programming models have been instrumental in the optimal synthesis and design of such complex systems. However, uncertainties in model parameters may result in economic losses or increased environmental emissions during actual operations. Uncertainties may be accounted for in the design procedure of an integrated biorefinery through target-oriented robust optimization methodology. This new approach identifies the optimal design of an integrated biorefinery by maximizing a robustness index against uncertainties. However, since practical engineering problems often involve satisfying multiple targets, a multi-objective target-oriented robust optimization approach is developed in this paper. This new approach allows the advantages of target-oriented robust optimization to be realized for multi-objective problems. A case study on the design of an integrated algal biorefinery, with both economic performance and environmental footprint considerations, is used to illustrate the methodology.

Several factors may contribute to such uncertainties. These include nodal demands, reservoir/tank levels, and availability of system components. Additional sources of uncertainties arise when water-energy nexus is considered. For instance, when water desalination systems that are coupled with power plants are incorporated in the water distribution networks, uncertainties in energy demand influence the design of the water network system. In this work, a multi-objective optimization framework is developed for the design of water networks that involve dual-purpose power plants for simultaneous water desalination and power generation. The multi-objective model accounts for sustainability goals through environmental, economic, and societal metrics such as greenhouse gas emissions, net profit, and number of jobs created, respectively. Fossil fuels, as well as renewable biofuels and solar power, are considered as candidate sources of energy. Water resources include multiple systems such as dams, lakes, rivers, aquifers, and artificial storage lakes. Demands from agricultural, industrial as well as domestic needs in the region are considered. In order to incorporate uncertainty in the proposed approach, a stochastic optimization model is formulated with a probabilistic objective function and constraints. The network has multiple sources as well as demands with varied distributions. In order to find an overall distribution for probability density estimation, a decomposition scheme is applied where each scenario is solved separately as a sub-problem. The solution from sub-problem is used to find the probability using kernel density estimator. The modified model equations lead to a stochastic MINLP problem.

The results of the optimization produce Pareto sets of optimal solutions for acknowledging the trade-off between the economic and the environmental criteria of the integrated system. It is found that the anaerobic digestion (AD) technology shows better performance in terms of an environmental perspective, displacing the excessive fertilizer requirements due to its maturity in comparison with the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process.

Two technologies of gasification named entrained flow and circulating fluidized bed are compared. Flowsheet modeling and thermo-economic analysis methods are applied, followed by a multi-objective optimization based on a genetic algorithm. The optimum Ethanol–Methanol biorefinery design options are compared with other previously studied sugarcane biorefineries. The results show that the biorefinery's energy efficiency increases significantly with the integration of a methanol production plant in a conventional ethanol distillery. The configuration using an entrained flow gasifier presents lower conversion efficiency than the one using a circulating fluidized bed gasifier. However, for the entrained flow gasifier configuration, the size of the methanol production process could be bigger since more heat is available for the ethanol process favouring the integration with the ethanol plant. Higher energy efficiency due to increase of methanol production leads to a higher total investment for both gasification technologies. The cost analysis shows that the calculated methanol production cost is 30% higher than its current market price.

Notably, biofuels have relatively lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to the fossil fuels. A biomass gasifier can convert lignocellulosic biomass such as wood into syngas, which can be used in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) to produce heat and electricity. SOFC has very good thermodynamic conversion efficiency for converting methane or hydrogen into electricity, and integration of SOFC with gasifier gives heat integration opportunities that allow one to design systems with electricity production efficiencies as high as 70%. Generally, process design and operational optimization problems have conflicting performance objectives, and Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) methods are applied to quantify the trade-offs among the objectives and to obtain the optimal values of design and operating parameters. This study optimizes biomass gasifier and SOFC plant for annual profit and annualized capital cost, simultaneously. A Pareto front has been obtained by solving MOO problem, and then net flow method is used to identify some optimal solutions from the Pareto front for the implementation into next phase. The constructed composite curves, which notify maximum amount of possible heat recovery, and first law efficiency also indicate better performance of the integrated plant. Uncertainty of market and operating parameters has been added to the optimization problem, and robust MOO of the integrated plant has been performed, which retains less sensitive Pareto solutions during the optimization. Finally, Pareto solutions obtained via normal and robust MOO approaches are considered for uncertainty analysis, and Pareto solutions obtained via robust MOO found to be less sensitive. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Gas turbine; Gasification; Multi-objective optimization; Net flow method; Robust optimization; Solid oxide fuel cell; Uncertainty analysis"

Most of the models developed to optimize biomass supply chains have failed to quantify the effect of biomass quality and preprocessing operations required to meet biomass specifications on overall cost and performance. The Integrated Biomass Supply Analysis and Logistics (IBSAL) model estimates the harvesting, collection, transportation, and storage cost while considering the stochastic behavior of the field-to-biorefinery supply chain. This paper proposes an IBSAL-SimMOpt (Simulation-based Multi-Objective Optimization) method for optimizing the biomass quality and costs associated with the efforts needed to meet conversion technology specifications. The method is developed in two phases. For the first phase, a SimMOpt tool that interacts with the extended IBSAL is developed. For the second phase, the baseline IBSAL model is extended so that the cost for meeting and/or penalization for failing in meeting specifications are considered. The IBSAL-SimMOpt method is designed to optimize quality characteristics of biomass, cost related to activities intended to improve the quality of feedstock, and the penalization cost. A case study based on 1916 farms in Ontario, Canada is considered for testing the proposed method. Analysis of the results demonstrates that this method is able to find a high-quality set of non-dominated solutions. © 2017 by the authors.","Bioenergy; Biofuels; Biomass; Discrete-event simulation; Logistics; Optimization; Renewable energy; Simulation-based optimization; Supply chain network design"

To this end, artificial neural network (ANN) coupled with fuzzy clustering method (FCM) to model exergetic outputs on the basis of input variables. The outputs of modeling system were then fed into a novel optimization approach developed by hybridizing additive linear interdependent fuzzy multi-objective optimization (ALIFMO) and the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The optimization was carried out to minimize the normalized exergy destruction and maximize the rational and process exergetic efficiencies, simultaneously. The solutions of the proposed approach were also compared with conventional fuzzy multi-objective optimization procedure with independent objectives. Overall, the modeling system predicted the exergetic parameters of photobioreactor with a coefficient of determination higher than 0.90. Furthermore, the optimization approach suggested syngas flow rate of 13.35 mL/min and agitation speed of 383.34 rpm as the best operational condition by considering the preferences of process exergy efficiency, rational exergy efficiency, and normalized exergy destruction, respectively. This condition could yield the normalized exergy destruction of 1.56, process exergetic efficiency of 21.66%, and rational exergetic efficiency of 85.65%.

The bioconversion of syngas to hydrogen via water-gas shift (WGS) reaction was carried out using the light-dependent microorganism Rhodospirillum rubrum and acetate as the sole carbon source. The RBF neural network was used to correlate exergetic outputs (normalized exergy destruction as well as rational and process exergetic efficiencies) to two exogenous input variables (culture agitation speed and syngas flow rate). The developed RBF model was interfaced with the proposed hybrid fuzzy clustering-ranking algorithm to simultaneously maximize the rational and process exergetic efficiencies and minimize the normalized exergy destruction. Moreover, the conventional fuzzy optimization algorithm was applied in order to assess the capability of the proposed approach over the existing methods for multi-objective optimization of complex biofuel production systems such as a continuous photobioreactor with respect to the sustainability and productivity issues. Once the development of the objective functions were carried out using RBF Neural Networks, the proposed algorithm was able to identify the optimum exergetically-sustainable operational parameters of carbon monoxide fermentation to biohydrogen with 20 clusters. This corresponded to the syngas flow rate of 13.68 mL/min and culture agitation speed of 348.62 rpm yielding the process exergetic efficiency of 16.46%, rational exergetic efficiency of 91.59%, and normalized exergy destruction of 2.14.

A hybrid Input-Output (IO) framework is developed for Brazil coupling the System of National Accounts and the National Energy Balance, which is extended to assess Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Life-cycle based estimates for two sugarcane cultivation systems, two 1G and eight 2G bioethanol production scenarios, are coupled in the IO framework. A multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) model is formulated based on this framework for energy-economic-environmental analysis of the Brazilian economic system and domestic bioethanol supply in prospective scenarios. Twenty-four solutions are computed: four “extreme” solutions resulting from the individual optimization of each objective function (GDP, employment level, total energy consumption and total GHG emissions - 1G scenario), ten compromise solutions minimizing the distance of the feasible region to the ideal solution (1G, 1G-optimized and prospective 1G + 2G scenarios), and ten solutions maximizing the total bioethanol production (1G, 1G-optimized and prospective 1G + 2G scenarios). Higher diesel oil and lubricants consumption in the mechanical harvesting process has counterbalanced the positive effects of more efficient trucks leading to higher energy consumption and GHG emissions. Lower overall employment level in the 1G + 2G scenarios is achieved such that policies linked to reabsorption of sugarcane cutters in alternative activities are positive. Indirect effects from maximizing the bioethanol production increase the total energy consumption and the GHG emissions thus requiring efficiency measures and fossil energy substitution by cleaner sources. The integrated- or country-based analysis of the whole economic system has complemented the process design and process-based analysis, contributing to identify direct and indirect effects that can offset the benefits. Direct and indirect effects on the whole economic system have to be considered in policies and technological choices for prospective bioethanol production, since positive direct effects of 1G + 2G plants can be counterbalanced by indirect impacts on other sectors, mainly from chemicals in the process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Hybrid modeling; Input-output analysis; Lignocellulosic bioethanol; Multi-objective linear programming; Multi-sectoral economy-energy-environment models"

In this paper, we quantify the potential social benefit of new forest-based biorefinery supply chains considering different impacts of new jobs based on their type and location. This social benefit is incorporated into a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model that maximizes the social benefit, net present value and greenhouse gas emission saving potential of a forest-based biorefinery supply chain. The applicability of the model is illustrated through a case study in the interior region of British Columbia, Canada where different utilization paths for available forest and wood residues are investigated. The multi-objective optimization model is solved using a Pareto-generating method. The analysis of the generated set of Pareto-optimal solutions show a trade-off between the net present value of the supply chain and the other two investigated objectives. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between the potential to generate high impact jobs in the region and its potential to generate greenhouse gas emission savings. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biorefinery supply chain; Forest-based biomass; Multi-objective optimization; Social benefit; Sustainability"

For this purpose, the conventional and innovative fuzzy optimization techniques coupled with multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural model to optimize the main exergetic performance parameters of the photobioreactor. The MLP neural model was applied to correlate three dependent variables (rational and process exergy efficiencies and normalized exergy destruction) with two independent variables (syngas flow rate and agitation speed). The developed MLP model was then interfaced with three different multi-objective fuzzy optimization systems with independent, interdependent, and locally modified interdependent objectives. The optimization process was aimed at maximizing the rational exergy and process efficiencies, while minimizing the normalized exergy destruction, simultaneously. Generally, the innovative locally modified interdependent objectives fuzzy system showed a better optimization capabilities compared with the other two fuzzy systems. Accordingly, the optimal syngas photo-fermentation for biohydrogen production in the continuous bioreactor corresponded to the agitation speed of 383.34 rpm and syngas flow rate of 13.35 mL/min in order to achieve the normalized exergy destruction of 1.56, rational exergy efficiency of 85.65%, and process exergy efficiency of 21.66%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Continuous photobiological hydrogen production; Exergetic optimization; Locally modified interdependent objectives fuzzy system; Multi-objectives fuzzy optimization techniques; Multilayer perceptron neural model"

Applying a multi-objective optimization model to high-resolution spatial data, potential tradeoffs among the objectives of minimizing feedstock costs, GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, and soil erosion were identified for a set of conversion facilities on an efficient frontier. The tradeoff relationship was primarily driven by the type of agricultural land converted to switchgrass. Hay and pasture lands were more cost effective but resulted in higher soil carbon losses and soil erosion after being converted to switchgrass. Converting crop lands reduced GHG emissions and soil erosion but caused higher feedstock cost primarily due to the higher opportunity cost of land use. The respective average costs of abating GHG emissions and soil erosion on the efficient frontier were $2378 Mg-1 and $10 Mg-1. The compromise solution conversion facility site generated 63% higher feedstock cost compared to the cost minimizing location, while reducing soil erosion by 70 fold and diminishing GHG emissions by 27%.

Irrigation water use is expected to increase in the near future due to several factors such as the growing demand of food and biofuel under a probable climate change scenario. For this reason, the improvement of irrigation water use efficiency has been one of the main drivers of the upgrading process of irrigation systems in countries like Spain, where irrigation water use is around 70 % of its total water use. Pressurized networks have replaced the obsolete open-channel distribution systems and on farm irrigation systems have been also upgraded incorporating more efficient water emitters like drippers or sprinklers. Although pressurized networks have significant energy requirements, increasing operational costs. In these circumstances farmers may be unable to afford such expense if their production is devoted to low-value crops. Thus, in this work, a new approach of sustainable management of pressurized irrigation networks has been developed using multiobjective genetic algorithms. The model establishes the optimal sectoring operation during the irrigation season that maximize farmer’s profit and minimize energy cost at the pumping station whilst satisfying water demand of crops at hydrant level taking into account the soil water balance at farm scale. This methodology has been applied to a real irrigation network in Southern Spain. The results show that it is possible to reduce energy cost and improve water use efficiency simultaneously by a comprehensive irrigation management leading, in the studied case, to energy cost savings close to 15 % without significant reduction of crop yield. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Genetic algorithm; Irrigation district management; Pressurized irrigation network; Soil water balance"

The impacts of energy crop integration are quantified in terms of productivity, economics, and environmental performance.

The results show that subfield management zones optimized to reduce economic losses and maximize environmental performance are capable of improving the field's annual rate of soil organic carbon (SOC) gain by 69%, reducing annual soil erosion by 63%, and increasing sustainable biomass availability by 35%. Environmental improvements are valued at US$158 ha-1 (US$64 ac-1), making the integrated management system an effective financial loss mitigation strategy compared to conventional corn production when feedstock prices are greater than US$107 Mg-1 (US$97 tn-1).

Bi-objective optimization models have been developed recently to support the optimum design of either bioenergy or biofuels supply chains considering economic as well as environmental impacts. In an integrated bioenergy and biofuels supply chain where biofuel producers are also users of the generated energy, the energy flows among co-located supply chain entities affect the environmental and economic objective functions and consequently the optimal design of the supply chain, therefore, the energy flows have to be considered in the optimization model.

In this context, the optimization of chemical reactors, particularly bioreactors and photobioreactors, is crucial to improve the production of biofuels in a sustainable manner. This paper reports the development of an optimization method and its application to the design of a continuous flow bioreactor envisaged to be used in industrial fermentation processes. Mass and momentum conservation equations are simulated via CFD and specific a posteriori performance parameters, determined from the flow solution, are fed into a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to obtain corrections to the parameters of the geometrical configuration of the reactor. This heuristics is iterated to obtain an optimized configuration vis-à-vis the flow aspects portrayed by the performance parameters, such as the shear stress and the residence time variations. An open source computer package (PyCFD-O) was developed to perform CFD simulations and the optimization processes automatically. First, it calls the pre-processor to generate the computational geometry and the mesh. Then it performs the simulations using OpenFOAM, calculates the output parameters and iterates the procedure. The PyCFD-O package has proved reliable and robust in a test case, a ∼1 m3 continuous fermentation reactor. The multiobjective optimization procedure actually corresponds to search for the Pareto frontier in the solution space characterized by its geometric parameters and the associated performance parameters (dispersion o residence times and shear stresses). Optimal design configurations were obtained representing the best tradeoff between antagonistic objectives, i.e. the so-called non-dominant solutions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Nowadays, these residues are disposed, but they could be used as feedstock for a biorefinery. Before implementing a biorefinery system to treat the residues from the tequila industry in Mexico, it is necessary to assess the economic and environmental performance of the entire supply chain for biofuel production. Developing a proper optimization framework for supply chain management in the tequila industry in Mexico that will consider all the activities involved along with the conflicting objectives of its daily operation represents a scientific challenge. Therefore, this paper presents a multi-objective optimization approach for designing such a supply chain that accounts for the simultaneous maximization of the net present value and environmental performance of the network. The environmental objective function accounts for impacts in ecosystem quality, human health and damage to resources. These are quantified through the eco-indicator 99 method. Numerical results show that the implementation of a biorefinery system in Mexico based on the residues from the tequila industry can provide significant economic and environmental benefits. Particularly, results indicate that the best economic solution shows a profit of 7.9 × 108 USD/year.

On the other hand, biofuels derived from cellulosic (energy) crops offer positive environmental impacts. In this study, we develop a multi-objective mixed-integer optimization model to investigate the trade-offs and competition between biofuel and food production using switchgrass and corn. This model maximizes total economic and environmental benefits and provides optimal decisions regarding land allocations to food and energy crops, seeding time, harvesting time and amount, and budget allocations to farm operations. A piecewise linear lower approximation is developed to linearize the nonlinear revenue curve of corn grain sales. Spatio-temporal environmental impacts such as soil erosion prevention, carbon sequestration and emissions, and nitrogen pollution are included in the model. The application of the model in Kansas indicates that switchgrass is more profitable than corn in cropland, while it requires Conservation Research Program (CRP) incentives for production on marginal land unless priority is given to the environment. In order to ensure food security, our study advises managers and policy makers to provide CRP incentives or to adjust the sustainability factor, which restricts cropland availability for biofuel production. Our spatio-temporal optimization model can also be adapted to different regions with alternative energy and food crops under various management scenarios.","Biomass and biofuel production; Economic and environmental analysis; Energy vs. food security; Multi-objective optimization; Sustainability and biodiversity; Switchgrass and corn"

This model was formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem which took economic, energy, and environmental criteria (3E) into consideration. The economic objective was measured by the total annual profit. The energy objective was measured by using the average fossil energy input per megajoule (MJ) of biofuel. The environmental objective was measured by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per MJ of biofuel. After carefully consideration of the current situation in China, we chose to examine three conversion pathways: bio-ethanol (BE), bio-methanol (BM) and bio-diesel (BD). LCA was integrated to a multi-objective supply chain model by dividing each pathway into several individual parts and analyzing each part. The multi-objective MILP problem was solved using a ε-constraint method by defining the total annual profit as the optimization objective and assigning the average fossil energy input per MJ biofuel and GHG emissions per MJ biofuel as constraints. This model was then used to design an experimental biofuel supply chain for China. A surface of the Pareto optimal solutions was obtained by linear interpolation of the non-inferior solutions. The optimal results included the choice of optimal conversion pathway, biomass type, biomass locations, facility locations, and network topology structure in the biofuel supply chain. Distributed and centralized systems were also factored into our experimental system design. In addition, the influence of price change on the optimal solutions was investigated. The optimal solutions obtained in this study reveal a tradeoff between the impact of the 3E criteria.

In this context, this study aims to investigate the economic and environmental aspects of sustainability associated with the integration of algal biodiesel production with a steam electric power plant for microalgae biofixation of CO<inf>2</inf> in flue gases and then algal biomass conversion to biodiesel. This integrated energy system is a multipurpose process that provides the CO<inf>2</inf> required by the microalgae cultures as well as electricity, biodiesel produced from the algal biomass, and lipid-depleted biomass which is in turn used as an auxiliary fuel in the power plant. A multi-objective optimization strategy based on genetic algorithms is proposed to yield a set of optimal solutions providing the best compromise between the profit and the environmental impact of regenerative Rankine power generation plants coupled with algae-to-biodiesel production facilities. The power plant operates continuously, but CO<inf>2</inf> is fed to open pond raceways only during the daytime (12 h a day) for algae growth. The rigorous IAPWS-IF97 formulation is used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of water and steam in the steam power cycle. The environmental impact is measured by the Eco-indicator 99 methodology that follows LCA principles. The optimization problem includes the selection of multiple primary energy sources for the power plant boiler, such as fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), biofuels, and biomass (switchgrass, softwood, and hardwood) in order to achieve significant reductions of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. The optimal trade-off designs are obtained by implementing the ε-constraint method. The optimization method has been applied to a case study in México. The Pareto optimal solutions indicate that the current price for biodiesel of $3.91/gal on average would make the integrated energy system under consideration profitable. In addition, the system could achieve significant environmental improvements due to life-cycle GHG reductions that result not only from biofixation of CO<inf>2</inf> from combustion flue gases by microalgae and then algal biomass conversion and use as renewable fuels (i.e., biodiesel and lipid-depleted biomass) that substitute for fossil fuels, but also by significantly reducing the fossil fuel requirement compared to stand-alone coal-fired power plants. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","GHG mitigation; Life cycle assessment; Microalgae biodiesel production; Multi-objective optimization; Steam power plants; Sustainable energy system"

The BBSS uses feedstock compositional data to estimate the mass balance for each of the seventeen production paths in the four categories of transesterification to biodiesel, hydrolysis fermentation to ethanol, gasification to syngas, fast pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading to liquid hydrocarbons, and anaerobic digestion to biogas. An ideal biofuel production process would have low cost, low carbon emissions, and high energy recovery from the feedstock. These three objectives are used in a multi-objective network flow optimization of the BBSS. In order to make biofuels feasible, no part of an energy crop/plant should go to waste, so the optimization assigns a combination of processes to treat different fractions of the feedstock. The results of the optimization for three representative biofeedstocks, rapeseeds, corn, and switchgrass, are discussed in detail with emphasis on how the importance assigned to a given objective impacts the optimal solution. Optimization results indicate that switchgrass should be treated with gasification or anaerobic digestion rather than ethanol fermentation. Rapeseed should be processed using transesterification though the results were too sensitive to make a distinction between different transesterification methods.

Although model cyanobacterial strains have been engineered to produce such products, systematic metabolic engineering studies to identify optimal strains for the same have not been performed. In this work, we identify optimal ethanol producing mutants corresponding to appropriate gene deletions that result in a suitable redirection in the carbon flux. In particular, we systematically simulate exhaustive single and double gene deletions considering a genome scale metabolic model of a mutant strain of the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis species strain PCC 6803. Various optimization based metabolic modeling techniques, such as flux balance analysis (FBA), method of minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA) and regulatory on/off minimization (ROOM) were used for this analysis. For single gene deletion MOMA simulations, the Pareto front with biomass and ethanol fluxes as the two objectives to be maximized was obtained and analyzed. Points on the Pareto front represent maximal utilization of resources constrained by substrate uptake thereby representing an optimal trade-off between the two fluxes. Pareto analysis was also performed for double gene deletion MOMA and single and double gene deletion ROOM simulations. Based on these analyses, two mutants, with combined gene deletions in ethanol and purine metabolism pathways, were identified as promising candidates for ethanol production. The relevant genes were adk, pta and ackA.

Quantification of trade-offs among objectives in bioenergy crop production is most frequently accomplished by a comparison of a limited number of plausible scenarios. Here we analyze biophysical trade-offs among bioenergy crop production based on rape seed, food crop production, water quantity, and water quality in the Parthe catchment in Central Germany. Based on an integrated river basin model (SWAT) and a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), we estimated Pareto optimal frontiers among multiple objectives. Results indicate that the same level of bioenergy crop production can be achieved at different costs with respect to the other objectives. Intermediate rapeseed production does not lead to strong trade-offs with water quality and low flow if a reduction of food and fodder production can be accepted. Compared to solutions focused on maximizing food and fodder yield, solutions with intermediate rapeseed production even improve with respect to water quality and low flow. If rapeseed production is further increased, negative effects on low flow prevail. The major achievement of the optimization approach is the quantification of the functional trade-offs for the feasible range of all objectives. The application of the approach provides the results of what is in effect an infinite number of scenarios. We offer a general methodology that may be used to support recommendations for the best way to achieve certain goals, and to compare the optimal outcomes given different policy preferences.

This research integrates the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) watershed model and the DayCent biogeochemical model to investigate water quality and soil greenhouse gas flux that results when corn stover is collected at two different rates from corn-soybean and continuous corn crop rotations with and without tillage. Multiobjective watershed-scale optimizations are performed for individual pollutant-cost minimization criteria based on the economic cost of each cropping practice and (individually) the effect on nitrate, total phosphorus, sediment, or global warming potential. We compare these results with a purely economic optimization that maximizes stover production at the lowest cost without taking environmental impacts into account. We illustrate trade-offs between cost and different environmental performance criteria, assuming that nutrients contained in any stover collected must be replaced. The key finding is that stover collection using the practices modeled results in increased contributions to atmospheric greenhouse gases while reducing nitrate and total phosphorus loading to the watershed relative to the status quo without stover collection. Stover collection increases sediment loading to waterways relative to when no stover is removed for each crop rotation-tillage practice combination considered; no-till in combination with stover collection reduced sediment loading below baseline conditions without stover collection. Our results suggest that additional information is needed about (i) the level of nutrient replacement required to maintain grain yields and (ii) cost-effective management practices capable of reducing soil erosion when crop residues are removed in order to avoid contributions to climate change and water quality impairments as a result of using corn stover to satisfy the RFS. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",""

To guide follow-up research activities efficiently, it must be assessed whether large-scale production of such next-generation biofuels is competitive in comparison with established biofuels like ethanol. However, it is very time-consuming to provide complete process designs for all alternatives, especially as important data are missing in the early development phase. Instead, reaction network flux analysis (RNFA) has been introduced recently for rapid screening of production routes to bridge the gap between catalysis research and process design. Using this approach, mass balances are formulated for a network of possible reactions such that multi-objective optimization techniques can be applied to identify the attractive pathways with high performance. Typical performance indicators like total annualized cost or environmental impact are adapted to the requirements of the early design phase and integrated in the flux analysis. In this paper, production performance indicators of ten novel biofuel candidates are compared to those of methanol, ethanol, butanol, and methane as reference fuels using RNFA. While some pathways already show an encouraging performance, the reaction yield of others must be increased significantly, if the target product should qualify as promising fuel candidates. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Bioeconomy; Biofuels; Biorenewables processing; Chemical process design; Multi-objective optimization; Reaction network flux analysis"

Bioethanol and biodiesel are the most commonly produced biofuels. Bioethanol is produced by fermenting sugar components of biomass (e.g., sugarcane, corn, cellulosic materials). Although ethanol production using sugar and starch as feedstocks is well established, it can still be improved. Ethanol concentration in the fermentor inhibits conversion of fermentable sugars to ethanol, which results in low yield and productivity; these can be improved by better fermentation kinetics and/or process design. Ethanol can be removed from the fermentor by using extraction or a membrane process. Recently, bioethanol production process with interstage extraction has been optimized. The present work models and optimizes a three-stage bioethanol process integrated with cell recycling and pervaporation for multiple objectives using multiobjective differential evolution. The integrated process, with glucose and xylose as feedstocks, has been optimized for both ethanol productivity and xylose conversion simultaneously.

The economic objective is measured by the total annualized cost, the environmental objective is measured by the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, and the social objective is measured by the number of accrued local jobs. A multiobjective mixed-integer linear programming (mo-MILP) model is developed that accounts for major characteristics of cellulosic ethanol supply chains, including supply seasonality and geographical diversity, biomass degradation, feedstock density, diverse conversion pathways and byproducts, infrastructure compatibility, demand distribution, regional economy, and government incentives. Aspen Plus models for biorefineries with different feedstocks and conversion pathways are built to provide detailed techno-economic and emission analysis results for the mo-MILP model, which simultaneously predicts the optimal network design, facility location, technology selection, capital investment, production planning, inventory control, and logistics management decisions. The mo-MILP problem is solved with an ε-constraint method; and the resulting Pareto-optimal curves reveal the tradeoff between the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of the sustainable biofuel supply chains.

The MILP model seeks to optimize the expected performance of the SC under several financial risk mitigation options. This consideration gives a rise to a multi-objective formulation, whose solution is given by a set of network designs that respond in different ways to the actual realization of the demand (the uncertain parameter).

This problem is expected to increase in the future with the increasing demand to provide corn as grain or stover for biofuel production. Best management practices (BMPs) have been proven to effectively reduce the NPS pollutant loads from agricultural areas. However, in a watershed with multiple farms and multiple BMPs feasible for implementation, it becomes a daunting task to choose a right combination of BMPs that provide maximum pollution reduction for least implementation costs. Multiobjective algorithms capable of searching from a large number of solutions are required to meet the given watershed management objectives. Genetic algorithms have been the most popular optimization algorithms for the BMP selection and placement. However, previous BMP optimization models did not study pesticide which is very commonly used in corn areas. Also, with corn stover being projected as a viable alternative for biofuel production there might be unintended consequences of the reduced residue in the corn fields on water quality. Therefore, there is a need to study the impact of different levels of residue management in combination with other BMPs at a watershed scale. In this research the following BMPs were selected for placement in the watershed: (a) residue management, (b) filter strips, (c) parallel terraces, (d) contour farming, and (e) tillage. We present a novel method of combing different NPS pollutants into a single objective function, which, along with the net costs, were used as the two objective functions during optimization. In this study we used BMP tool, a database that contains the pollution reduction and cost information of different BMPs under consideration which provides pollutant loads during optimization. The BMP optimization was performed using a NSGA-II based search method. The model was tested for the selection and placement of BMPs in Wildcat Creek Watershed, a corn dominated watershed located in northcentral Indiana, to reduce nitrogen, phosphorus, sediment, and pesticide losses from the watershed. The Pareto optimal fronts (plotted as spider plots) generated between the optimized objective functions can be used to make management decisions to achieve desired water quality goals with minimum BMP implementation and maintenance cost for the watershed. Also these solutions were geographically mapped to show the locations where various BMPs should be implemented. The solutions with larger pollution reduction consisted of buffer filter strips that lead to larger pollution reduction with greater costs compared to other alternatives. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Atrazine; Biofuel; BMP tool; Multi-objective genetic algorithms; Nonpoint source pollution; Optimization"

Nonlinear regression has been used to regress the experimentally obtained data to predict the brake thermal efficiency, NO<inf>x</inf>, HC and smoke emissions based on injection timing, blend ratio and power output. To acquire the data, experimental studies have been conducted on a single cylinder, constant speed (1500 rpm), direct injection diesel engine under variable load conditions and injection timings for neat diesel and various Karanja biodiesel blends (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 50% and 100%). Retarding the injection timing for neat Karanja biodiesel resulted in an improved efficiency and lower HC emissions. A tradeoff relationship between the NO<inf>x</inf> and smoke emissions is observed, which makes it difficult to determine the optimum blend ratio. The functional relationship developed between the correlating variables using nonlinear regression is able to predict the performance and emission characteristics with a correlation coefficient (R) in the range of 0.95-0.99 and very low root mean square errors. The outputs obtained using these functions are used to evaluate the multi-objective function of optimization process in the 0-20% blend range.

Four different biorefinery schemes considering the different uses of crude glycerine from the biodiesel process are simulated and compared: (i) the disposal of crude glycerine as a waste, (ii) the purification (through distillation) of crude glycerine to 80%, (iii) the purification of glycerine to 95%. and (iv) the production of succinic acid from glycerine through fermentation. For the latter, we consider the bioprocess that converts the glycerol to succinate, and a downstream separation process that purifies and crystallises our product to the final succinic acid crystals. To apply complex kinetics for the fermentation we have linked Aspen Plus (2006.5) with Matlab (R2007b), where we have used the experimentally-based unstructured model from Vlysidis et al., 2009 and 2010. We first determine the operating parameters of the fermentor that have a significant effect on the economics of this scenario, i.e. the cycle time of the batch fermentation and the water flowrate entering the bioreactor. Subsequently, we perform single- and multi-objective optimisation to maximise the profit and/or to minimise the environmental impact of the overall process. We then analyse and compare the economics of the four different biorefinery schemes by using well-known profitability and/or emission criteria. Furthermore, we carry out sensitivity analysis that takes into consideration price variations for the most important materials and we extract firm conclusions about the profitability of each scenario. It is found that succinic acid co-production can enhance the profit of the overall biorefinery by 60% for a 20 years plant lifetime.

The competitive potential of biodiesel is limited by the price of vegetable oils, which strongly influences the final price of biofuels. An appropriate planning and design of the whole production process, from the seed to the biodiesel end product, is essential in order to contain the fallout of energy inefficiencies in the high price of the end product. This study focuses on the characteristics of the production process currently used to produce biodiesel. Refined vegetable oil can be converted into biodiesel by means of a great variety of techniques and technologies, many of which are still not suitable for application on an industrial scale. The solution of greatest interest is homogeneous alkaline transesterification with KOH and methanol. Even when dealing with this type of conversion, it is impossible to establish a universal pattern to describe the conversion or purification stages because there are various possible solutions that make each system different from another. When we look more closely at the state of the art in industrial biodiesel production plants, we also encounter the potential problems introduced by the type and characteristics of the raw materials. Comparing some of the reference solutions that have inspired numerous installations, an optimization analysis was conducted using ASPENPLUS 2006, for the modeling of the process, and modeFRONTIER 4.1 for the optimization procedure. The optimization analysis was carried out using a multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization in order to define the configuration of the main parameters that guarantee the best trade-off between the maximization of the purity of some important compounds and the minimization of energy requirements in the process. The results of this analysis were Pareto frontiers that identify a family of configurations which define the best trade-off between the objectives. Using the Pareto frontiers we then selected the configuration that requires the minimum energy consumption. Among these optimal configurations there is one which guarantees the lowest specific energy consumption while all the optimal configurations obtained respected the requirements of EN 14214, in terms of biodiesel quality.

In this case study, tax credit policy in the French bio-fuel industry producing ethanol and esters is determined. Micro-economic models simulate the agricultural sector and the bio-fuel industry through multi-level mixed integer linear programming. Aggregate supply of energy crops at the national level is estimated using a staircase model of 450 individual farm sub-models specialising in arable cropping. The government acts as a leader, since bio-fuel chains depend on subsidies. The model provides rational responses of the industry, taking into account of the energy crops' supply, to any public policy scheme (unitary tax exemptions for bio-fuels subject to budgetary constraints) as well as the performance of each response regarding total greenhouse gases emissions (GHG), budgetary expenditure and agents' surpluses. Budgetary, environmental and social concerns will affect policy decisions, and a multi-criteria optimisation module projects the decision maker aims at the closest feasible compromise solutions. When public expenditure is the first priority, the best compromise solution corresponds to tax exemptions of about 2 FF1-1 [FF: French Franc (1Ε equivalent to 6.559 FF)] for ester and 3 FF1-1 for ethanol (current tax exemptions amount at 2.30 FF-1 for ester and 3.30 FF1-1 for ethanol).
